Just ask [Dallas Cowboys wideout Dez Bryant](http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/9/7/6118901/dez-bryant-hit-cowboys-49ers).\r\n\r\nNext month, Bethea will look to deliver hits of a different kind. The Niners safety is partnering with Clear Vision to host the first annual Antoine Bethea and Friends Celebrity Softball game on June 11.\r\n\r\nThe event will take place in the South Bay at San Jose Municipal Stadium, home of the San Francisco Giants Class A Advanced affiliate.\r\n\r\nGates open to the public at 1:00 p.m. with a meet-and-green on the field lasting until 1:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nA half hour later, partcipants will swing for the fences in a home run derby competition. First pitch for the game itself is scheduled for 3:15 p.m.\r\n\r\nMany of Bethea's Niners teammates will fill the rosters. Attendees include [<span>Carlos Hyde</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/carlos-hyde/4f42b0dc-515b-4f87-a1d6-f01ad9b53825/ \"Carlos Hyde\"), [<span>Ahmad Brooks</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/ahmad-brooks/f721f9db-d51e-4ab5-9b23-b1dcf7c4f12f/ \"Ahmad Brooks\"), [<span>Bruce Miller</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/bruce-miller/da22438c-7658-43dd-9f2b-9e09430d144c/ \"Bruce Miller\"), Michael Vick, Maurice Jones-Drew and Robert Mathis  – to name a few.\r\n\r\nTickets for the event can be purchased [online here](https://www.ticketreturn.com/prod2/BuyNew.asp?EventID=182736#.Vz3qIpMrKL7) or call (406) 297-1435. All proceeds will benefit the Second Harvest Food Bank of San Jose, Santa Clara and San Mateo.\r\n\r\nWho knows, maybe you'll be lucky enough to play on one of the teams yourself? (See tweets below)  \r\n\r\n> The celebrity roster and new additions will be released each week prior to the big game June 11th!

            "Content": "Bowman admitted that he really only paid attention to the first round of the NFL Draft last week, but he did say that he was very aware of who the 49ers took with the seventh overall selection. Buckner, a 6-foot-7 mammoth of a defensive lineman, should be able to eat up blocks at the point of attack and allow Bowman to make plays.\r\n\r\n“I felt like that was a great pick,” Bowman said. “He looks like a big guy that’s going to keep the big guys off of me. I’m glad to have him.”**He has confidence in the team’s inside linebackers**  \r\n\r\nOne position the 49ers didn’t address in the draft was inside linebacker. That decision to spend the team’s 11 draft choices elsewhere showed a vote of confidence in [<span>Michael Wilhoite</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/michael-wilhoite/deb9c0c9-1040-4028-94bf-0e8b0867fe58/ \"Michael Wilhoite\") and [<span>Gerald Hodges</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/gerald-hodges/4b8ed3fe-3eec-456f-998a-4efde6e6faac/ \"Gerald Hodges\"), two of the top candidates to start next to Bowman in 2016.\r\n\r\n“It’s a group of smart guys, and that’s what you want,” Bowman said of his fellow inside linebackers. “You want guys who can think fast in adverse times. I feel like this group is the perfect group for it. We have guys who are always willing to learn new things, no matter who the guy is. I learn new things from those guys still to this day. I’m never thinking I’m the best at anything, I just always want to continue to get better, and I think everyone’s attitude is that way.”**[<span>Tank Carradine</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/tank-carradine/d3def88f-c81c-4f09-b871-30be0e4ed83c/ \"Tank Carradine\") has impressed thus far**  \r\n\r\nThe question, “What player has caught your eye?” elicited one of Bowman’s most interesting responses. The linebacker’s answer was Carradine, who has four sacks in his NFL career since being selected in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft.\r\n\r\n“I can say he’s definitely progressed from his first year to now,” Bowman said. “He knows that he has to play this year. He has to contribute in a big way. The way he came back, in shape, moving fast and embracing the move to outside linebacker has been a real eye-opener for me.”**The new coaching staff is already gaining respect of the players**  \r\n\r\n",

He is currently recovering from an ACL suffered during practice in October of last year. In 2014, Redmond appeared in 12 contests and tallied 51 tackles and three interceptions.\r\n\r\nGeneral manager Trent Baalke said that Redmond was ranked even higher on their board than No. 68. Baalke added that he's confident the cornerback will be back on the football field sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n\"We had him valued higher than where we took him,\" Baalke said during his press conference following Day 2 of the draft. \"We're very comfortable with where he's at and very comfortable that he'll be ready to go come training camp.\"\r\n\r\nHere is Redmond's scouting profile, courtesy of [NFL.com](http://www.49ers.com/news/article-2/San-Francisco-49ers-Draft-Stanford-G-Joshua-Garnett/e8e0fc7e-455f-4533-8b8a-18a436cf17b5):\r\n\r\n\"Plus athleticism for the position. Plays with desired twitch and foot quickness. Has the physical tools to match up in tight, man coverage and mirror receiver with quality pattern recognition. Has burst to close out throws quickly and challenge the catch. Aggressive and determined in run support. Unafraid to step downhill challenge the run on his terms and near the line of scrimmage\"",

            "Content": "Ward, 24, added that working on the outside during OTAs will help with his press coverage and man-to-man techniques. The 5-foot-11, 193-pound defensive back made his presence known by intercepting a tipped pass during 7-on-7 work.  \r\n\r\nThe team's first-round draft pick from 2014 has no issues with moving to cornerback.  \r\n\r\n“As long as I’m on the field,\" he said, \"I’m good.”  \r\n\r\nEarlier this offseason, Ward played slot cornerback and safety at the team's pre-draft minicamp. The biggest difference in playing cornerback is the amount of running and attention to detail on technique. Ward added that there is less communication as a cornerback compared to safety, who are the ones to relay coverages across the backend of the defense.  \r\n\r\nWard sounded and looked like a player who was relishing the opportunity to do more for his team.  \r\n\r\n\"I think that’s exactly why I’m doing it, just to get me more reps on the field in different kinds of packages that we may run,\" Ward said.  \r\n\r\nBecause Ward made significant strides in his game a season ago, the timing to give him more responsibilities also makes sense.  \r\n\r\nWard won the [Matt Hazeltine award](http://www.49ers.com/news/article-2/San-Francisco-49ers-Announce-2015-Team-Awards/b6e5c4ba-ba96-46fe-b777-6c6c5ad25373) last year as the franchise's most courageous and inspirational defensive player. Ward played in all 16 games last season for the first time in his young NFL career. He started in eight contests and recorded 65 tackles, plus his first career sack and his first interception, which was returned for a score against the Chicago Bears.  \r\n\r\nWard said he took a lot of confidence from how he overcame a nagging foot injury as a rookie to produce his best NFL season as a sophomore.\r\n\r\n\"Just being able to play elite wide receivers and actually being successful in some of those games really built (my) confidence up,\" he said. \"Coming off my rookie year and being hurt, you kind of lose confidence. But I stayed in the film room and tried to build that back up.\"  \r\n\r\nNow, Ward is building more confidence while running stride for stride with the likes of [<span>Torrey Smith</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/torrey-smith/23a56c17-da51-4cdc-bb58-e00dff9b2c84/ \"Torrey Smith\"), [<span>Quinton Patton</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/quinton-patton/58e6921b-95f1-4e71-9dc6-083e830d9b2a/ \"Quinton Patton\") and the other receivers on the 49ers roster.  \r\n\r\nWard later voiced confidence in his ability to cover perimeter wideouts around the league.   \r\n\r\nFacing shifty slot receivers like Tavon Austin of the Los Angeles Rams will do that for you.",

But you know, for me it's about being on an adventure, finding out who you are, and pushing and growing as a person.”\r\n\r\nOther can’t-miss moments were shots from Hayne’s going-away party in Australia and his family’s reaction to when he learned he made the 49ers 53-man roster in August. Watch the full video above, which includes interviews with his mother, agent and even one-time coach/trainer Jay Glazer.",

My teammates and I have been hard at work getting ready for opening day and we can’t wait to see and meet fans at every event and game. Bring your energy, because you know we’ll have ours!    \r\n\r\n **YURI: **Are you guys ready to win?!**What do you like most about being a member of the Gold Rush?YURI: **Sharing every moment, being a part of the family and smiling together with the 39 other beautiful ladies.  \r\n\r\n **What have you learned from being a member of the Gold Rush?**\r\n\r\n** MARISSA: **Being a member of the Gold Rush has taught me about the legacy of inspirational women that I am now so honored to be a part of. I have learned to be more positive, hardworking and to motivate others I am surrounded by.  \r\n\r\n **How would you describe our style?YURI: **I would like to say ‘Dreamer.’ I moved to the United States from Japan to be a part of the Gold Rush because it’s my dream.**Can you walk us through a day in your life? MARISSA: **My day always begins with coffee. Next I spend the day teaching middle school sports, fitness, social skills and so many other activities in their P.E. class. Every so often, I run a few miles during my lunch break. After school I am an advisor for students in a hip hop dance club. Once I get home I usually work out, cook a healthy dinner and depending on the evening I may head out to either a slow pitch softball game, attend youth group as a leader for high school students, bible study or unwind at a yoga class.\r\n\r\n <table width=\"310\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"> <tbody> <tr> ",

Bring your energy, because you know we’ll have ours!    \r\n\r\n **YURI: **Are you guys ready to win?!**What do you like most about being a member of the Gold Rush?YURI: **Sharing every moment, being a part of the family and smiling together with the 39 other beautiful ladies.  \r\n\r\n **What have you learned from being a member of the Gold Rush?**\r\n\r\n** MARISSA: **Being a member of the Gold Rush has taught me about the legacy of inspirational women that I am now so honored to be a part of. I have learned to be more positive, hardworking and to motivate others I am surrounded by.  \r\n\r\n **How would you describe our style?YURI: **I would like to say ‘Dreamer.’ I moved to the United States from Japan to be a part of the Gold Rush because it’s my dream.**Can you walk us through a day in your life? MARISSA: **My day always begins with coffee. Next I spend the day teaching middle school sports, fitness, social skills and so many other activities in their P.E. class. Every so often, I run a few miles during my lunch break. After school I am an advisor for students in a hip hop dance club. Once I get home I usually work out, cook a healthy dinner and depending on the evening I may head out to either a slow pitch softball game, attend youth group as a leader for high school students, bible study or unwind at a yoga class.\r\n\r\n <table width=\"310\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"> <tbody> <tr> ",

My teammates and I have been hard at work getting ready for opening day and we can’t wait to see and meet fans at every event and game. Bring your energy, because you know we’ll have ours!    \r\n\r\n **YURI: **Are you guys ready to win?!**What do you like most about being a member of the Gold Rush?YURI: **Sharing every moment, being a part of the family and smiling together with the 39 other beautiful ladies.  \r\n\r\n **What have you learned from being a member of the Gold Rush?**\r\n\r\n** MARISSA: **Being a member of the Gold Rush has taught me about the legacy of inspirational women that I am now so honored to be a part of. I have learned to be more positive, hardworking and to motivate others I am surrounded by.  \r\n\r\n **How would you describe our style?YURI: **I would like to say ‘Dreamer.’ I moved to the United States from Japan to be a part of the Gold Rush because it’s my dream.**Can you walk us through a day in your life? MARISSA: **My day always begins with coffee. Next I spend the day teaching middle school sports, fitness, social skills and so many other activities in their P.E. class. Every so often, I run a few miles during my lunch break. After school I am an advisor for students in a hip hop dance club. Once I get home I usually work out, cook a healthy dinner and depending on the evening I may head out to either a slow pitch softball game, attend youth group as a leader for high school students, bible study or unwind at a yoga class.\r\n\r\n <table width=\"310\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"> <tbody> <tr> ",

            "Content": "\r\n\r\n*This offseason, we want you to get to know our players a little more off the field.   \r\n\r\nWhile you may be aware wide receiver Tyrell Williams became the 15th player in Chargers history to surpass 1,000 receiving yards, here are five fun facts you may not know about number 16.*\r\n\r\n**First Job **– “My first job was a dishwasher at The Blue Goat restaurant.”  Like many of his Chargers teammates, Williams’ held his job during the summer.  “I hated being back in the kitchen for four hours every day.  But, it was cool because I got tips, got to play music and got free lunch every day!”\r\n\r\n**Music Man – **And speaking of music, Williams says his favorite artist is J. Cole.  “My favorite song is probably anything off of *2014 Forest Hills Drive*.”  He also listens to Tupac, jazz and “anything old school.”  If you’re looking for something more current, Williams recommends the new Kendrick Lamar album *DAMN.* \r\n\r\n**Game of Choice **– The wide receiver spends part of his off time playing video games.  His favorite is NBA 2K.  “I play with guys on the team but I like it because it’s a competitive thing.”\r\n\r\n**Trusty Transportation **– “I still have my first car.  It’s a ’96 Pontiac Grand Prix.”  According to Williams, it has a giant Jordan sticker on the back. “I got it going into college and I still have it.  It has about 264,000 miles on it but it still rolls!”\r\n\r\n**T-6 – **When Williams first got to the Chargers, he wore number 6.  Former Charger Stevie Johnson took the undrafted rookie free agent under his wing and gave him the moniker that still has stuck to this day: “T-6”.\r\n\r\n## FIND OUT MORE FIVE FUN FACTS ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE CHARGERS:\r\n\r\n[Brandon Mebane](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/04/five-fun-facts-about-brandon-mebane)  \r\n[Dwight Lowery](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/05/five-fun-facts-about-dwight-lowery)  \r\n[Jatavis Brown](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/06/five-fun-facts-about-jatavis-brown)  \r\n[Denzel Perryman](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/10/five-fun-facts-about-denzel-perryman)  \r\n[Hunter Henry](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/11/five-fun-facts-about-hunter-henry)  \r\n[Josh Lambo](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/12/five-fun-facts-about-josh-lambo)   \r\n[Casey Hayward](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/18/five-fun-facts-about-casey-hayward)  \r\n[Derek Watt](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/19/five-fun-facts-about-derek-watt)  \r\n[Keenan Allen](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/24/five-fun-facts-about-keenan-allen)  \r\n[Trovon Reed](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/25/five-fun-facts-about-trovon-reed)  \r\n[Darrell Stuckey](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/26/five-fun-facts-about-darrell-stuckey)  \r\n[Damion Square](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/05/02/five-fun-facts-about-damion-square)",

            "Content": "The Los Angeles Chargers’ 2017[ draft class has earned rave reviews](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/05/01/chargers-draft-grades-what-experts-have-say) from the likes of ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr., NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah, MMQB’s Peter King and many more.\r\n\r\nAs with every team, some draft picks will make their presence felt immediately. Others will require additional seasoning to make an impact. \r\n\r\nJoey Bosa and Hunter Henry proved the former a year ago, emerging as two of the top playmakers at their respective positions.  One year later, Max Tuerk looks to follow in their footsteps.  His goal following what amounted to a red-shirt rookie year is to lock down a starting center or guard position  when the Bolts kick off the season on Monday Night Football in Denver.\r\n\r\n“I’m working to earn that starting job.  I want to get strong and better.  I want to keep getting my weight up.  I’m working to get better overall, but I am (focused) on getting that starting job.”\r\n\r\nThe Chargers selected Tuerk with the 66th overall pick, and immediately tempered expectations for his contributions in 2016.  After all, the center was coming off an ACL injury suffered the previous October. Even though Tuerk was able to participate as early as training camp, the Bolts knew it would take time for the athletic center to fully feel like his old self.\r\n\r\nWhile you may not have seen the USC product on the field last year, rest assured he was plenty busy.  Tuerk clung to Matt Slauson’s hip pocket, soaking up everything the grizzled vet had to offer.  He got valuable practice reps while at the same time allowing his knee to fully heal.\r\n\r\n“Last year I wasn’t able to play at all, but I took a lot of reps in practice.  I worked hard getting back from the knee injury.  I got my body stronger and mentally prepared for the NFL. I think it helped a lot.  Being able to get stronger in the weight room, get my knee better, really study the playbook and learn from (Slauson) was important.”\r\n\r\nEven though Tuerk sees value in his rookie year, it was difficult to go through at the time.\r\n\r\n“Of course I wanted to play. It was a learning experience.  Again, I look at it (now) as an opportunity to get better, which was good.”\r\n\r\nIn the coming days, Tuerk will be joined by two new rookie offensive linemen taken on day two of the draft just like he was a year ago.\r\n\r\nSo, what is his advice for Forrest Lamp and Dan Feeney?\r\n\r\n“Just work hard. That’s most important. Work hard. Just know there is a great support system here.  Really lean on the older guys because they will help you a lot. The veterans here are good mentors and help a lot.”",

            "Content": "\r\n\r\n*This offseason, we want you to get to know our players a little more off the field.   \r\n\r\nWhile you may know defensive tackle Damion Square inked a new two-year contract in March, here are five fun facts you may not know about number 71. *\r\n\r\n1.  **Ping Pong Player**: Just like Josh Lambo, Square loves playing ping pong.  “I’m like a table tennis champion.  It gets really intense in my house!  I go through about three tables every year.  I can break some tables when I get (ticked).”  Square said he started playing in college and wasn’t very good.  Once his wife bought him a table for their anniversary, he got hooked.   \r\n\r\n2.  **Various Nicknames**: Square has a few nicknames but says they’re all dependent on a period in his life.  “When I was in high school, people would call me D-Sho.  If I’m in public and I hear someone say ‘Hey, D-Monster!’ then I know you knew me when I was really young.”  Currently, he goes by Square.  “I have one of those last names that becomes your nickname, but sometimes people don’t believe it’s my last name until people look it at for a while.”  \r\n\r\n3.  **Man’s Best Friend**: Whether for protection or companionship, Square admits he will always have a dog.  “It will always be a black and white American bulldog or pitbull.  I won’t go a day without a dog.”  Square gave away his last dog to a family who went through a tragedy, and that very same day, went to a shelter and picked up a similar breed.  His current dog, Brobee, is five years old.   \r\n\r\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/BSkKHE1A0hk/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSkKHE1A0hk/)\r\n4.  **Enchilada Master**:  Thanks to an aunt, Square can get down in the kitchen.  “I don’t *like *to cook but I can cook very well.  I’m not into standing over a hot stove but I can direct a very good meal.”  If Square *is* cooking, his go-to cuisine is Mexican and Tex-Mex.  “It’s good, fast and an easy-prep meal.”  His favorite thing to make are beef enchiladas.     \r\n\r\n5.  **Every Tattoo Tells a Story**: Though he has a lot, Square counts his tattoos by sessions.  He thinks he’s been to the shop about seven times.  “Each one has significance based not on necessarily what they say, but by the period in my life.  I know what made me go to the shop to get that specific tattoo.”  He got his favorite tattoo when he was 19.  It is on his left forearm and reads “Love, Blood & Loyalty”.\r\n\r\n## FIND OUT MORE FIVE FUN FACTS ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE CHARGERS:\r\n\r\n[Brandon Mebane](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/04/five-fun-facts-about-brandon-mebane)  \r\n[Dwight Lowery](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/05/five-fun-facts-about-dwight-lowery)  \r\n[Jatavis Brown](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/06/five-fun-facts-about-jatavis-brown)  \r\n[Denzel Perryman](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/10/five-fun-facts-about-denzel-perryman)  \r\n[Hunter Henry](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/11/five-fun-facts-about-hunter-henry)  \r\n[Josh Lambo](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/12/five-fun-facts-about-josh-lambo)   \r\n[Casey Hayward](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/18/five-fun-facts-about-casey-hayward)  \r\n[Derek Watt](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/19/five-fun-facts-about-derek-watt)  \r\n[Keenan Allen](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/24/five-fun-facts-about-keenan-allen)  \r\n[Trovon Reed](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/25/five-fun-facts-about-trovon-reed)  \r\n[Darrell Stuckey](http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/04/26/five-fun-facts-about-darrell-stuckey)",

          "Body": {
            "Content": "**The Patriots defense went through a lot of changes, but they’re still pretty good and pretty active aren’t they?**<br>“Yeah, it’s a good group. They’ve still got some of their core guys there. They’ve had a few changes but all in all it’s the same scheme and they play it well. As you’ve seen, they had one hiccup two weeks ago. Other than that they have been winning games which is what they’re used to doing there. So it will be as tough as it always is against those guys.”<br> <br>**You guys have faced them a lot over the last couple of years. Do you call this a rivalry?**<br>“I think a rivalry is when the win/loss record is kind of back and forth. They’ve won the last three in a row I guess it is. We’ve had some good games, some games that have had a lot of meaning to them playing with a lot at stake. This one, although it is early in the regular season, has a lot at stake for us and for both teams I think. As we’ve seen, this AFC is going to be tough. There is going to be a lot of teams down the stretch and we want to be one of them. This game is going to have a big impact on that.”<br> <br>**You guys have won seven in a row at night at home. Do you think playing Sunday night primetime will help out?**<br>“Playing at home for one is an advantage as we’ve shown. We win at home. Our fans and our stadium, the way we play there, we obviously win. Hopefully that will be the case Sunday. Certainly we feel that there is a home field advantage at home and we’re certainly glad they’re coming to our place as opposed to us having to go back out there.”<br> <br>**Any different preparation this week to try to get you guys to start off faster?**<br>“No, I don’t think so. Again, I don’t think there is any magic to it. We could come off the first drive offensively and go down and get three (in) thirteen plays. We would have liked to get seven there but we kind of felt like we got off to a good start last week and then we just sputtered there for a while. I think that if we prepared differently this week, then we’ve been cheating ourselves the last five weeks, so I don’t think that’s the case. We’ve got a focused group out there in practice today. I thought it was good. We’ve just got to keep playing and grinding and hopefully get on a little roll.”<br> <br>**Does seeing these guys again remind you of what you had to go through last January?**<br>“It certainly brings back memories, some tough ones watching the tape. Obviously we have their game film from this year but you always go back and watch how they played you in previous games. Watching that AFC Championship game was tough to watch. It brings back a lot of thoughts of plays you wish you’d have made and how you felt and all kinds of different scenarios that were going on at the time. But it’s a new game like it is every time. Every time you go out there it’s different. They’ll be some different things both teams will do and hopefully we’ll be the team that makes the best adjustments and comes out on top.”<br> <br>**Usually you two playing each other is a battle of the AFC super powers. Would you say that this time it’s more of two teams trying to salvage their seasons?**<br>“It’s tough to say that.  Those guys have only lost one game. They lost one game at home and they’ve done nothing but win besides that, so it’s tough to use the word ‘salvage’ for those guys. I even think that it’s hard to use that word for us but it is a big game for us, like they all are. When you find yourself 2-3 and the division leader at 4-1, certainly there’s some ground to be made up. We can’t make it up in one week but we understand what this can do for us as we move forward.”<br> <br>**How are you feeling physically?**<br>“I feel good. There are different weeks and days where you’re more sore than others, but I feel fine physically. I think there are a lot of guys banged up and that’s the way it is across the league. Managing that and tolerating some of it is just part of it and we’ve got a lot of guys that deal with it week to week.”<br> <br>**Some players and coaches have gone out of their way to talk about your performance in the AFC Championship last year. Does that matter or mean anything to you?**<br>“You certainly appreciate your peers and competitors around the league having a compliment for you. I’ve always appreciated any of those remarks from last year but they only go so far and take you so far. We find ourselves 2-3 and really haven’t played well the past two games and you can throw that game out the window at this point. But certainly because you feel like you have different respect and thoughts of other guys as well for how they play the game, the way they approach it. They have a lot of those guys that know how to play it and play it well and I think that’s why they find themselves in the thick of it every year. Last year they were obviously undefeated all year. The year before that they struggled and came out here and beat us in the playoffs. They find themselves in it every year and I think it’s because of the players and they have the right kind of guys on that team.”<br>",

            "Content": "**On the difference is makes as a corner when the defensive line provides so much pressure:**<br>“It makes a big difference. It makes our job a whole lot easier. We can have a time clock in our head of how fast the ball is going to come out. When you apply pressure the ball comes out faster. It gives us DBs a chance to make plays on the ball…badly thrown balls or under thrown balls.”<br> <br>**On playing better in coverage:**<br>“I only got thrown at, I think, once the whole game, so I can’t say I *played*…I feel like these past three games I’ve been playing pretty good coverage. I’ve just been basically trying to work on my technique. I’m still dealing with my hip. Yesterday I felt a lot more comfortable than I ever did in the past four games. So it’s been going well with rehab and things like that.”<br> <br>**On how different the Patriots looked with Cassel:**<br>“With Cassel, you can tell he’s never been in that predicament. This is his first time, I think, trailing from behind. You can tell the difference between him and Tom Brady because Brady knew what he wanted to do and things like that. He is a lot more comfortable in the pocket.”<br> <br>**On defending the deep part of the field:**<br>“We went out and just played the way we were supposed to play. As a secondary we were a lot more comfortable, we communicated a lot more. That helps out a lot when you’re out there communicating, it makes things easier and everyone is on the same page.”<br> <br>**On if there is a correlation between Cassel being in there and him not getting any balls thrown to his side:**<br>“No. If you look back at the playoffs, I didn’t get thrown to either back in the AFC Championship game. I don’t see anything. They came at me one when we were in a Zero Blitz. It was an overthrown ball. I was beat then, but I don’t see anything that they changed.”<br> <br>**On what kind of pride he takes in knowing they shut down one of the best receivers in the league:**<br>“We just go out and do our job everyday. That’s what we’re supposed to do. We feel like we have two of the best corners in the NFL playing the position and we play at a high level right now.”<br> <br>**On the goal-line stand:**<br>“Oh, man. That felt good. I think that goal line stand took a lot out of New England. They’re down on the two-yard line and couldn’t get in the endzone. I feel that are confidence and knowing what we’re capable of doing every single week.”<br> <br>**On the play that got the Patriots down to the two-yard line:**<br>“The one I got ran over on? I have to make that tackle. I’ve been working hard this whole season and offseason working on tackling and it’s unfortunate I didn’t make that tackle. The defense that went in on goal line, they stood strong and we kept them out the endzone.”<br> <br>**On Quentin Jammer’s performance:**<br>“He’s having a Pro Bowl performance. He’s playing like a Pro Bowler every single week. He’s a consistent corner, playing the way he’s supposed to play. You never get anything different from Jammer every single week. To me, he’s the most consistent corner that I’ve ever seen since I’ve been playing in the NFL, every single week, week in and week out.”<br> <br>**On being leery about the very long two-game road trip:**<br>“No. I think it’s going to be fun. There’s a lot of doubters out there saying we can’t play on the road, and now it’s time to shut them up. We just have to go out there and have fun and play like we play last night. Who knows what the outcome will be?”<br> <br>**On rattling Cassel:**<br>“With our front seven we feel like we can rattle any quarterback. It’s just a point of going out and doing the things we’re supposed to do and playing the way we’re supposed to play.”<br> <br>**On what he’s looking forward to in London:**<br>“I just want to go sight seeing. I’m going to buy a digital camera and a video camera. I just want to enjoy it. It’s my first time going to London. I just want to go over there and enjoy it with my teammates and have fun.”<br> <br>**On media in London:**<br>“I don’t know. I’m just looking forward to going over there, period.”<br> <br>**On the fans in London being neutral:**<br>“I think it’s going to be exciting. I think it’s going to be like high school football, everybody is for everybody. You can’t take a game too seriously. You have to go out and have fun and enjoy it.”<br>",

          "Body": {
            "Content": "**After all the battles with the Patriots the last couple of years, would you call this a strong rivalry?**<br>“We aren’t looking at it as a rivalry. They’re obviously a good team and we’re obviously a good team. It’s just going to be a fun game to get two good teams under the stars on Sunday Night Football in primetime. It’s going to be a shootout.”<br> <br>**Does it get you more pumped up that it is primetime?**<br>“Definitely. You’re supposed to be pumped every game, but there’s nothing like it when all eyes are on you.  You’re the only game on and that’s what everybody’s watching if you’re a football fan.”<br> <br>**Was there anything done this week to spark a faster start Sunday?**<br>“We prepare the same way every week. We go out and have our same schedule every week like we did last year when we were (11-5). It’s the same exact way. We prepare the same way. Obviously we feel we need to start a little bit faster and we’re going to. Too bad we can’t jump all the way to Week 16. We’ve got to start one week at a time and we’ve got to get out and do what we need to do this week first.”<br> <br>**Does the fact that it’s primetime add a little pressure?**<br>“Pressure? No. I was always taught that pressure makes diamonds. That’s what I’m going to continue to believe. That’s just how it is. You’ve got to thrive in pressure. I look for it. Growing up, it’s something I’ve always looked for and it’s something I expect. I expect to win and I expect to be good.”<br> <br>**How different are they with Matt Cassel in there?**<br>“They’re a little different. I wouldn’t say a lot different because of the fact that they still have the same weapons on the outside, the same guys catching the ball, the same guys blocking, the same guys running. It’s just a different guy throwing the ball to them. Brady’s obviously one of the best quarterbacks of our generation. It’s tough without him but they’re an experienced group of guys. That’s how their system is. They can just throw another guy in there and get the job done. That’s what Cassel’s going to do. He’s going to get the job done.”<br> <br>**The Patriots used a direct snap last week. What are your thoughts on defending the direct snap after what you saw last week?**<br>“I thought we did an okay job. Forty-five yards isn’t too bad considering what Miami was able to do to New England. They had 100 and something. They had 45 on us in the wildcat stuff. It’s something that you obviously have to prepare for, but you don’t place your whole game plan on trying to stop two or three plays that they may or may not do. There are other things that we’ve got to do, general tendencies that we have to go through that we have to prepare for first before we can just only prepare for a direct snap to a running back.”<br> <br>**What has to change defensively for you guys to get back to the standard that you played at during the second half of last season?**<br>“I don’t think we’re playing bad football. We’re not playing the best football, but you hold a team to 17 points, that’s usually winning football. The mindset of a defensive player is if your team has three points, you’ve got to hold the other team to two. That’s how it should be. We’re not playing bad football. We’re not playing great, but there’s obviously room for improvement and we’re prepared to do whatever it takes to get where we need to go and do what we need to do to win football games.”<br> <br>**Is there a sense in the locker room that this team is coming together?**<br>“Every day I feel like that. We can’t rest on our laurels of last year of, ‘We did it last year, we can do it this year.’ Every team is different around the league. Like I tell everyone, we prepare the same way every day. There’s always energy in our locker room. Guys are always fired up and guys are always ready to practice. We prepare to win football games. Unfortunately we came out on the wrong end of it, but we’re 2-3 and we have 11 more games to go. We can only start with this one. That’s the only way to get us going on the right track to see if we can do what we did last year.”<br>",

My teammates and I have been hard at work getting ready for opening day and we can’t wait to see and meet fans at every event and game. Bring your energy, because you know we’ll have ours!    \r\n\r\n **YURI: **Are you guys ready to win?!**What do you like most about being a member of the Gold Rush?YURI: **Sharing every moment, being a part of the family and smiling together with the 39 other beautiful ladies.  \r\n\r\n **What have you learned from being a member of the Gold Rush?**\r\n\r\n** MARISSA: **Being a member of the Gold Rush has taught me about the legacy of inspirational women that I am now so honored to be a part of. I have learned to be more positive, hardworking and to motivate others I am surrounded by.  \r\n\r\n **How would you describe our style?YURI: **I would like to say ‘Dreamer.’ I moved to the United States from Japan to be a part of the Gold Rush because it’s my dream.**Can you walk us through a day in your life? MARISSA: **My day always begins with coffee. Next I spend the day teaching middle school sports, fitness, social skills and so many other activities in their P.E. class. Every so often, I run a few miles during my lunch break. After school I am an advisor for students in a hip hop dance club. Once I get home I usually work out, cook a healthy dinner and depending on the evening I may head out to either a slow pitch softball game, attend youth group as a leader for high school students, bible study or unwind at a yoga class.\r\n\r\n <table width=\"310\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\"> <tbody> <tr> ",

My next pursuit as a side dream job would be to get my yoga teaching certification and become a yoga instructor.\r\n\r\n**Can you walk us through a day in your life?**\r\n\r\n**SHASTA: **I’m a morning person so a day in my life would start bright and early with a long run and a healthy breakfast!

            "Content": "  \r\nOnce the draft concludes, the wait begins for the other shoe to drop. John Lynch said immediately following the conclusion of Day 3 that the San Francisco 49ers were already on the phone with undrafted free agents.\r\n\r\nSome names have been circulating, but now we have the entire list of 18 undrafted prospects who have signed with San Francisco. Here’s the rundown along with a brief bio of each player.**Nick Mullens, QB, Southern Mississippi** \r\n\r\nMullens was a four-year starter at Southern Mississippi and finished his career with 11,994 passing yards and 87 touchdown passes. His best season came in 2015 when he threw for 4,476 yards and 38 touchdowns to just 12 interceptions. He joins the 49ers after adding 3,272 yards and 24 touchdowns to his collegiate numbers as a senior in 2016.**Cole Hikutini, TE, Louisville**\r\n\r\nHikutini served as the safety valve for Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Lamar Jackson in 2016. He caught 50 passes for 668 yards and eight touchdowns. Those numbers earned Hikutini second-team All-ACC honors. He began his career at Sacramento State before transferring to City College of San Francisco for one year. Hikutini is [said to have](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/cole-hikutini?id=2558179) “speed to attack over the top of linebackers and run under a deep ball.”**Lorenzo Jerome, DB, Saint Francis**\r\n\r\nThe 5-foot-10 safety turned heads at the 2017 Reese’s Senior Bowl following a standout senior season for the Red Flash. Jerome earned first-team FCS All-American honors following his six interceptions, 59 tackles and 11 pass breakups in 2016. He also added 14 kick returns for 405 yards and a touchdown. Jerome [has](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/lorenzo-jerome?id=2558206) “outstanding instincts and ball skills.” For what it’s worth, his NFL draft profile projected him to go in the fourth or fifth round of the draft. ESPN’s Todd McShay also had Jerome as his top-ranked undrafted player.**Matt Breida, RB, Georgia Southern**\r\n\r\nBreida’s production dipped a bit in 2016. However, the ball-carrier scored 17 touchdowns in both 2014 and 2015. His 1,609 rushing yards in 2015 were a career-high.**Erik Magnuson, OL, Michigan**\r\n\r\nMagnuson was named first-team All-Big Ten in 2016, and his [NFL Draft profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/erik-magnuson?id=2557926) calls him “one of the better right tackles in the nation.” The 6-foot-6 lineman has starting experience at both guard and center.**Kendrick Bourne, WR, Eastern Washington**\r\n\r\nBourne was one half of the most prolific receiving tandem in FCS history, along with fellow Eagle Cooper Kupp. The 6-foot-1 wideout earned All-Big Sky honors three times. In 2016, Bourne caught 79 passes for 1,201 yards and seven touchdowns.**Darrell Williams Jr., OL, Western Kentucky**\r\n\r\nThe 6-foot-5 lineman made 41 career starts for the Hilltoppers split between his time at right tackle and right guard.**KD Cannon, WR, Baylor**\r\n\r\nCannon is the latest weapon to come out of Baylor’s wide receiver factory over the past five years. He posted 1,215 yards and 13 touchdowns for the Bears in 2016. Cannon has outstanding vertical speed as evidence by his 4.41 40 time at the NFL Combine. His pre-draft [profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/kd-cannon?id=2557975) projected him as a fourth-fifth round pick.**Victor Bolden, WR Oregon State**\r\n\r\nIn four years for the Beavers, Bolden caught 170 passes for 1,863 yards and seven touchdowns.**Jimmie Gilbert, LB, Colorado** \r\n\r\nGilbert found his stride as a senior in 2016 with 14 tackles for loss and 11 sacks. The 6-foot-5 pass-rusher has plenty of length to use to his advantage. Gilbert comes from a basketball family and had a scholarship offer to play hoops at Stephen F. Austin out of high school.**John Flynn, OL, Montana State**\r\n\r\nFlynn was a four-year starter for the Bobcats and a first-team All-Big Sky Conference selection.**Noble Nwachukwu, DE, West Virginia**\r\n\r\nNwachukwu played all four years for the Mountaineers and was productive for the final three. He finished his career with 117 total tackles, 26.5 tackles for loss and 13 sacks. His pre-draft [profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/noble-nwachukwu?id=2557990) projected him as a fifth-sixth round pick and called him “agile and explosive.”**Donavin Newson, LB, Missouri**\r\n\r\nNewson led the Tigers with 73 tackles in 2016. He added 5.5 tackles for loss, three sacks and four pass breakups.**Bret Treadway, OL, Lamar**\r\n\r\nIf his medicals weren’t a concern, Treadway would have been a highly-touted prospect. His NFL Draft [profile](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/bret-treadway?id=2557946) calls him “one of the most athletic interior lineman in the 2017 draft.” The four-year starter could prove to be a post-draft steal in San Francisco.**Tyler McCloskey, FB/TE, Houston**\r\n\r\nThe linebacker-turned-fullback-turned-tight end quite literally did it all at Houston. His well-rounded career stats include 39 receptions for 406 yards and five touchdowns. McCloskey added 16 tackles on defense.** Malik Golden, S, Penn State**\r\n\r\nThe two-year starter for the Nittany Lions had a breakout year in 2016 with 75 tackles, one interception and three pass breakups.**Evan Goodman, G, Arizona State**\r\n\r\nGoodman started 23 games at left tackle over the past two seasons for the Sun Devils. At 6-foot-4, he possesses NFL size.**Zach Franklin, CB, Washburn**\r\n\r\nFranklin played in 45 career games (34 starts) at Washburn and totaled 109 tackles and four interceptions. In 2016, he recorded 38 tackles, three picks, 21 pass breakups and a fumble recovery.",

He’s coached Warner, Marc Bulger and Philip Rivers to Pro Bowls and has been a big asset to Chargers Head Coach Norv Turner during Ramsdell’s tenure with the Bolts.<br> <br>“Rams does a great job, starting in the offseason working with the fundamentals of playing the position to game-planning and game preparation,” Turner said. “He’s done a great job with Philip and all of our quarterbacks.”<br> <br>As the Cardinals prepare to face the Steelers Sunday at Raymond James Stadium, Warner’s tale has been recounted continually this week in Tampa. No one knows it better or appreciates the story more than Ramsdell. <br> <br>",

            "Content": " <br>Prior to joining the Bolts in 2006, Ramsdell spent 11 seasons with the [St. Louis Rams](http://www.stlouisrams.com/).  He instructed tight ends and H-backs for three years before being assigned to quarterbacks coach in 1999, where he was by Warner’s side during the former Arena League star’s ascension from obscurity to superstardom. <br> <br>In the spring of 1999, the Rams signed free agent Trent Green to lead Mike Martz’s fast-paced attack. Warner spent 1998 as the third quarterback and entered 1999 as the backup. But three games into the preseason, Green suffered a torn knee ligament against the Chargers, which thrust Warner into the limelight.<span>   </span><br> <br>“We were just kind of grooming Kurt to get ready to be our backup; to be the next guy in,” Ramsdell recalls. “We didn’t know that was going to be a month later.”<br> <br>Warner embraced his opportunity and produced one of the most amazing seasons in league history. Although he’d never taken a snap in the NFL prior to that year, Warner tossed 41 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions while leading St. Louis to a 13-3 record. He was named league MVP and earned Super Bowl MVP honors after leading the Rams to a win over the Titans.<br> <br>Ramsdell watched Warner grow throughout the year, and the now-two-time NFL MVP believes his former quarterbacks coach deserved a great deal of credit for his immediate success. <br> <br>“Johnny was awesome,” Warner said.  “Any questions that I had, anything that I wasn’t sure of, he was right there.  He was a detail-oriented guy, always staying on top of the little things from technique to reads to making sure that we were all 100 percent sure what we were supposed to do on any play versus any coverage.”<br> <br>Since 1999, Ramsdell has seen two other young quarterbacks thrive. Bulger won the starting job in St. Louis in 2003 and when 12-3 in his first year at the helm of an NFL offense. In 2006, Ramsdell oversaw Rivers’ first season as a starter, a year in which the Bolts went 14-2. <br> <br>Warner praises Ramsdell’s football intelligence and even-keel approach but believes that his ability to handle his players has led to much of his success.<br> <br>“I don’t think there’s anything more important for a young guy than to be encouraged,” Warner said.  “You know you’re going to make mistakes.  You know you’re going to have some rough times.  You need a coach that knows how to coach you while encouraging you, coach you while keeping you confident in what you can do.  I can’t say enough about what Johnny did for me.”<br> <br>Ramsdell and Warner do their best to stay in touch, although they haven’t spent much time together since Warner joined the [New York Giants](http://www.giants.com/) in 2004. Ramsdell is humbled by Warner’s approach to life and proud of his perseverance. <br> <br>“Kurt’s just a great person,” Ramsdell said. “He’s very selfless, cares about other people and has a great attitude on life. He’s all about giving. He has a huge family and he has a great responsibility and love for them. <br> <br>“He went through some tough times after losing the starting job in St. Louis, going to New York and then had his up and downs with the Cardinals. Once it was decided that he was the guy in Arizona, he just took off. It’s been great to see.”<br> <br>Ramsdell and the Chargers faced the Steelers twice this season. While Pittsburgh led the NFL in nearly every defensive category in 2008 and is heavily favored Sunday, Ramsdell warns fans against counting Warner out. <br> <br>“The way I think about NFL football right now, it’s a 50-50 game,” Ramsdell said. “The season we had in San Diego, every game was a flip of the coin. I just think Kurt is so good and those receivers are so good.  They’ve got such a high-powered offense and have all the momentum going right now. I think they’ve got a great chance of winning the game.”<br>",

            "Content": " <br>**Now that you’ve had some time to reflect, how much fun was the last month of the season for you personally?**<br>“December was fun for all of us. We’re disappointed we fell short and didn’t play longer. I had fun (in 2007) too, but I got a lot more touches this past season. I feel like I’ve taken steps each season. This season it was a big step and I had a lot of fun.   \r\n\r\n\"It takes some time to process it. During this time, I don’t really think much about football. I just try to relax. It’ll all sink in once I start my training and thinking about next season.”<br> <br>**What are you doing while you’re in Tampa?**<br>“I’m about to visit radio row here in the media center to do some interviews. I just started a partnership with Yardbarker.com so I’m promoting that a little bit. I went to the Madden Bowl party last night. I’ve got a couple appearances scheduled at the NFL Experience over at the stadium. I’ll sign some autographs over there.”<br> <br>**When you were at the Madden Bowl, did you watch Antonio Gates play in the tournament?**<br>“Yeah, but he can’t play (laughing). No, he did pretty good. He made it to the semifinals and got beat by Justin Tuck. I gave him a hard time about losing but he’s really good.”<br> <br>**What are you plans for the next couple of months?**<br>“I’m not going to do anything special. I’ll be back and forth from San Diego to Kansas City. I want to spend some time with my family. I’ll probably start my offseason workouts at the beginning of March sometime.”<br> <br>**You’re an unrestricted free agent this spring. What do you hope happens?**<br>“I want to stay in San Diego but we have to wait and see what happens. Your second contract, that’s the one where you have a chance to take care of yourself and your family. I enjoy my teammates and love playing for the Chargers. We’ll just see how things go down.”  <br> <br>**Were you aware that the Chargers Team Store at Qualcomm Stadium ran out of number 43 jerseys in January?**<br>“No, I didn’t know that, but that’s cool to hear.   When I first got to the Chargers, they didn’t sell my jersey in the stores. To get it sold out, that feels good. I really appreciate how all of our fans support our team and support me. People stop me a lot and always have nice things to say. It’s really nice.”<br> <br>**What are your thoughts about Sunday’s game?**<br>“I think Pittsburgh is going to win. Their defense is so tough. They force turnovers and make big plays. When their offense gets it, they can go on long drives and hold the ball like they did against us. That keeps Arizona’s playmakers off the field, so I like the Steelers Sunday.”<br>",

Johnson spent the last two years as the [Oakland Raiders](http://www.raiders.com/)’ defensive tackles coach. He previously served as the defensive line coach in Chicago (2005-06). Johnson helped Bears defensive tackle Tommie Harris earn two Pro Bowl appearances and oversaw the development of defensive end Mark Anderson, who recorded 12 sacks as a rookie in 2006. <br> <br>",

However, a look at Turner’s history as a play-caller doesn’t support that notion. <br> <br>As both a head coach an offensive coordinator, Turner has called plays for five different NFL rushing champions. That list includes LaDainian Tomlinson in 2007, Miami’s Ricky Williams in 2002 and Emmitt Smith, who won three-consecutive rushing titles with the Cowboys from 1991-93. Turner has seen two other running backs – Frank Gore in 2006 and Stephen Davis in 1999 – lead their respective conference in rushing under his watch. <br> <br>Turner has served as the offensive coordinator in Dallas, San Diego, Miami and San Francisco and has called offensive plays in each of his 11 seasons as an NFL head coach (San Diego, Oakland and Washington). In those 18 seasons, he’s produced 15 1,000-yard rushers, including LT’s rookie season of 2001 with the Chargers. <br> <br>",

            "Content": " <br>In addition to his history with rushing champions, Turner has seen his leading ball-carrier finish in the top 10 in the NFL in rushing an astonishing 13 times, including LT’s 10th place finish in 2008.<br> <br>Turner’s pursuit of balance has produced another interesting statistic. On seven different occasions, Turner has called plays for a team that featured a 3,000-yard passer, a 1,000-yard rusher and a 1,000-yard receiver. The Chargers accomplished that feat in 2008 (Philip Rivers, Tomlinson and Jackson) as well as during Turner’s lone season as the club’s offensive coordinator in 2001 (Doug Flutie, LT and Curtis Conway).<br> <br>His teams recorded the “triple crown” twice in Dallas (’92 and ’93), twice with the Redskins (’96 and ’99) and again in 2005 with the Raiders.     <br> <br>In 2008, the Chargers threw just seven more passes than they did in 2007. However, they ran 57 fewer plays in Turner’s second season as head coach. <br> <br>Several factors contributed to their decline in opportunities. Bolts’ opponents scored first in 10 of their 16 contests, and teams that fall behind typically have to throw the ball more to catch up. The Chargers also won the time-of-possession battle just five times during the regular season.  <br> <br>The Bolts didn’t enjoy the success they’d hoped for on the ground early in the season, which put them in passing situations on second and third down and forced them to throw the ball more. <br> <br>“I don’t think it was ever as bad as perceived,” Turner said late in the season.  “We went a stretch of games where we played Buffalo and we only had 50 offensive snaps.  You can’t really get yourself going in that environment.  We had a tough time getting teams off the field early.  There are a lot of reasons.” <br> <br>The Chargers got things going on the ground in the final month of the season. During their four-game winning streak in December, the Bolts averaged 151 rushing yards per game, including a franchise-record 289 yards in their regular-season finale against Denver. <br> <br>Turner has won AFC West titles in each of his two seasons as the Chargers’ head coach. While he acknowledges that balance is key, results are the ultimate goal of his offense. <br> <br>“I’ve been in this offense all the way back,” Turner said. “It’s the same offense we ran with the Rams back in ‘87, so it’s going on 30 years. When we won, the balance was great. When we didn’t, the balance was bad. There (were) times (in 2008) I don’t think we threw the ball enough based on the way people were playing us. I’d love to be able to line up and have them play in a look every down where you can run or pass. And I’d like to be good enough that it doesn’t matter what they’re playing. You can say, ‘We’re going to run it, and they can’t stop us.’\"<br>",

Smith, under fire for recent comments about the status of running back LaDainian Tomlinson, decided he owed the future Hall of Famer a phone call to clear the clouds of misinformation and speculation.  So he picked up the phone on Monday evening and found Tomlinson in Tampa, Florida.   \r\n\r\n“It was important to me that L.T. know exactly what happened,” Smith said referring to comments he made in the San Diego Union-Tribune regarding statements on L.T.’s web site.    \r\n\r\n“I just answered a question and unfortunately my response was inappropriate,” said Smith, who has sat in the GM’s chair since 2003.  “After reading my response to the question, I can see why it was interpreted the way it was.\r\n",

I have the utmost respect for him on two fronts, as a player and as a person.”  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, Smith was hurt by some the comments made by the local and national media.  Though stung by the reaction, Smith was comforted by those who know him best.  \r\n\r\n“Dean Spanos and many members of our front office and coaching staff know exactly how I feel about L.T., and that is what has gotten me through this difficult time.  \r\n\r\n“And most important, L.T. knows how I feel about him.”   \r\n\r\nSmith characterized the 10-minute conversation as “a great talk … the kind of talk we have at the beginning of each season.”  \r\n\r\nLike Smith, Tomlinson had nothing but positive vibes from the phone call.  \r\n\r\n“It was great to hear from him,” said the five-time Pro Bowl performer.  “It really went well.  It’s always better talking directly to someone one on one.  He was very upbeat and very sincere.  He felt bad about what had happened.”",

            "Content": "   \r\n\r\nFor the next two weeks all eyes will be on a Russian resort town turned sports mecca for the 22nd Winter Olympiad in Sochi. While the winter games have seen NFL players come home empty handed, the Summer Olympics have been fertile ground for success stories. In all, 31 players that have worn an NFL uniform have won medals, including long jump silver medalist and San Diego Charger Bo Roberson.\r\n\r\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1935, Irvin “Bo” Roberson became one of the greatest multi-sport athletes to come out of the City of Brotherly Love. After enrolling in a prep school, Roberson attended Cornell in the fall of 1954, lettering in football, basketball and track. In his three years on the gridiron, Roberson rushed for 1,175 yards on 348 carries and scored nine touchdowns. He also caught 16 passes for 224 yards and one TD. While his football talent was evident, it was his track and field skills that would be his true calling card in college.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from Cornell in 1958, Roberson dominated the 1959 Pan-American Games, leaving his competition in the dust.  He jumped more than a foot further than the second place finisher. In 1960 he jumped even further at the National AUU Indoor Championships, beating Jesse Owen’s 25 year indoor record with a leap of 25-9 ½. Soon after, it was off to Rome for the Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nHe was not expected to medal in 1960, a year with a strong pool of talent entering the long jump. Yet as the competition wore on, the Philadelphia native had the last jump – and a chance for Olympic gold. He also had a famous fan in the stands rooting him– Jesse Owen. Owen’s 1936 record for the long jump still stood and he had arrived in Rome feeling “like a father who has come back to watch his successful children.” Unfortunately, Roberson came up one centimeter short of winning the gold, earning the silver medal.\r\n\r\nA year later it was Roberson’s exploits in Philadelphia, not Rome, that would earn him his ticket to the AFL. Al LoCasale, a Chargers personnel man, had also gone to high school in Philly and recommended Roberson to then Chargers coach Al Davis.\r\n\r\n“Bo went to Bartram High and I went to Olney in the same league,” remembered LoCasale. “What I remembered about him was his tremendous speed and his tremendous ability, and that he was put together like a football player, not a skinny track kid. When I remember back, I remember his speed, his acceleration, his takeoff.”\r\n\r\nThe Chargers and Roberson would both arrive in San Diego in 1961. In that first season with the Bolts, Roberson would do a little of everything – returning kicks, catching passes and running the ball. The former Olympian rushed for 275 yards (second most on the team) and got in the end zone three times for the Chargers. Roberson also caught six passes for 81 yards. His former work as a sprinter also paid off as a return man for San Diego, averaging 15.9 yards per return.\r\n\r\nThe Chargers would go 12-2 their first year in San Diego, making it to the AFL Championship game against the Houston Oilers at Balboa Stadium. In a tough contest, Roberson would lead the team in rushing yards with 37 on eight attempts. Despite the Bolts best effort, they fell to the Oilers 10-3.\r\n\r\nDespite a promising 1961 season, Bo Roberson’s first year in San Diego would also be his last. That offseason Roberson would leave San Diego along with two other Chargers in exchange for the rights to the Oakland Raiders’ 2nd round pick, a fair haired wide out from the University of Arkansas – Lance Alworth.\r\n\r\nRoberson would play five more years in the NFL before returning to school and coaching. After attending Stanford Law School, Roberson would earn his doctorate from United States International University (now Alliant International University) here in San Diego. Although Roberson passed away in 2001 he still is alone in a unique club - the only person to have an Ivy League degree, a Ph.D., an Olympic medal and a career in NFL. Not bad for a kid from west Philadelphia. ",

          "Body": {
            "Content": "**\r\n\r\n“There are several things that I was very pleased with about what our team was able to do. The first thing, we made a big emphasis during the week when you go play in Kansas City. You have to handle the environment, the crowd noise, the reputation. You have to handle the early start and we spent a lot of time putting a plan together that would allow us to get in there and get off to a fast start. I think our players responded to that plan. We got off to a fast start in all three phases of the game. The other thing is for our team to be the kind of team we want to be and have the kind of season we’re looking to have. We’re going to have to handle adversity on a week to week basis. Obviously we didn’t play as well in the Atlanta game as we hoped or planned to but you have to respond and come back. We can’t let last week affect us negatively. Also responding to adversity in games and in both of those areas our guys were outstanding. We got great performances and in some cases their best game ever. We had a great performance from Nick Novak on Friday afternoon to come here and pick up right where he left off from training camp. It was extremely impressive. We had a great performance in the kicking game from Melvin Ingram. He was on all four special teams, he played 20 plays in the kicking game, he had four tackles. It was certainly his best performance in that area which is critical for us because every guy that can contribute in the kicking game makes a difference. Defensively there is no question in my mind, Corey Liuget and Vaughn Martin played their best game probably since they’ve been here. They were outstanding, very aggressive and a great push. I was very impressed with the things they were able to do. I thought Jeromey Clary, that was a tough match up for him. They have good rushers and I thought he played extremely well. The one thing that was my concern going into Kansas City, they have a lot of players that can change the game. They have an outstanding running back that is leading the game in rushing, they have two outstanding receivers, big guys that made big plays and are obviously capable. We’ve obviously had a tough time when we’ve been there, handling their rushers. You have to put a plan together that says be able to manage and control these aspects. For the most part we were able to do that. When we didn’t I think it showed that these are explosive guys. Jamaal Charles made a great run and he used his abilities to make an outstanding run. Fortunately he was only able to do that once in the game and that was a big part of our success. For the things we addressed and focused on for the most part we were able to get done. We had a few stretches there where we struggled offensively but that’s the type of defense this team has. They have been able to shut people down in spurts and you’re able to get plays on them. I thought our guys managed the tough spots and responded in the fourth quarter with two scoring drives, a touchdown drive and a field goal drive. Obviously the key to our game was being able to attack defensively and create six turnovers. If you do that you’re going to win most of the time.”\r\n\r\n**On whether kicker Nick Novak is better than other NFL kickers:**\r\n\r\n“I just think that it’s a matter of personal opinion. If you’ve had the level of exposure we’ve had with Nick, if I was somewhere else I would certainly think I would feel good about him kicking. He’s better than some of the kickers I’ve worked with in the past.”\r\n\r\n**On linebacker Donald Butler’s performance:**\r\n\r\n“Donald’s performance was outstanding. I didn’t mention him because he’s been playing at that level. I wanted to mention Corey and Vaughn because I thought that was another level for them. Donald has been playing at that level and he just keeps getting better and better. He’s a really good football player.”\r\n\r\n**On telling the defensive players to play fast and not think so much:**\r\n\r\n“We’ve talked about reacting to what you see and trusting what you see. That comes with experience and I think from a standpoint of what we’re trying to get done upfront and with some things we did a little different in the game, is continue to have a mindset that we’re going to be aggressive with the calls but we’re going to be aggressive within the calls. You can be an aggressive football player within any defensive call. You can be an aggressive football player with any offensive call. That’s what we’re trying to get done.”\r\n\r\n**On whether the defensive scheme was altered after the loss to Atlanta:**\r\n\r\n“I don’t think we ever change anything completely. We have a system that we trust and believe in. We used some things that I think helped us in that game and got our guys started a little bit. There are things that we have in our play book. Obviously Atlanta posed some different problems than we had in Kansas City. As I said after the Atlanta game, we have a lot of new moving parts in players and coaches. My goal starting Monday of last week was to make sure we learn from what happened in Atlanta and take from that to help us get better.”\r\n\r\n**On running back Ryan Mathews playing limited minutes but still putting up yards:**\r\n\r\n“I think they had 30 carries between them [Mathews and Battle]. I liked the mixture we had. Ryan came in on the screen and got a big play early. I think every week we’re going to look at what gives us the best chance to win; we’ll put a game plan together and try to implement it. Both guys obviously were effective in their own way.”\r\n\r\n**On who starts the game at each position being overrated:**\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it is to the players because I think it is important to them but from a standpoint of our team now, we have so many different guys that can contribute. We’re week one and Antonio Gates can’t play and Dante Rosario goes and catches three touchdowns and he hasn’t been utilized a lot since then. There are only so many balls. We have a lot of guys who can contribute and be a part of this. If we keep a mindset of what matters, each week finding a way to win, yeah I think it is overrated who starts. I understand a player’s mentality of wanting to be a guy and be the starter.”\r\n\r\n**On the possibility of defensive coordinator John Pagano taking time off due to his brother being diagnosed with Leukemia:**\r\n\r\n“Chuck Pagano worked for me in Oakland and Chuck was a graduate assistant when I was at USC so I’ve known him since 1984. He’s a great guy, a great person, and obviously an outstanding coach. He’s a heck of a father and as Jim Irsay said today, he’s going to beat it. John found out about this on Wednesday morning and that’s one of the things that as coaches, there’s a commitment that you make to a group of guys and John handled it as well as you can handle it during the week. It was a very difficult week for him, it was a combination of things. You get all caught up in losing a game to Atlanta and on Wednesday morning you get a call that your brother has Leukemia. It puts things into perspective and John did an unbelievable job handling what he had to handle.”\r\n\r\n**On whether Ryan Mathews learned his lesson by limiting his exposure during the game:**\r\n\r\n“Ryan was put in a tough spot. You miss entire camp for the most part, the first couple games and you come up and everyone is six weeks ahead of you. He handled it extremely well. He had one bad play against Atlanta and if he had 100 carries and no fumbles and had a fumble on that play, he got hit really hard on that play in the Atlanta game but it doesn’t make it ok. You can’t fumble the ball. Everyone thinks it is to send a guy a message but the best thing for us in the Kansas City game was to start Jackie Battle and give him and our offense a chance to get into some rhythm. On a feel when it was the right time, we wanted to give Ryan the opportunity to be a part of it. As the game went on he became a big part of it. He understands the importance of taking care of the ball. He’s not negligent. I don’t think there is anyone that works any harder. He had a bad play in the Atlanta game but I do believe that we’re going to get past that.”\r\n\r\n**On having the regular referees back and returning to the general rhythm of the game:**\r\n\r\n“That was probably the hardest thing, trying to establish the rhythm. No one was at fault because obviously if you get thrown into the middle of something like that it was a real challenge. It was great to have the officials back, they a great at what they do. Like a lot of things, all of the sudden they aren’t there and you realized it was pretty good before. It’s not going to be perfect, we all know that. We’ve all been in situations where we’ve benefitted from a call that wasn’t exactly right and I’ve been in situations where we’re at the other end of it.”\r\n\r\n**On kicker Nate Kaeding’s status:**\r\n\r\n“Nate is being evaluated as we speak. He was very sore on Friday when he had the injury. He went through the process of having and MRI and seeing a specialist. We’ll know more as the week goes on. I would not anticipate him kicking for a while.”\r\n\r\n**<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Quarterback Philip Rivers</span>**\r\n\r\n",

          "Body": {
            "Content": "\r\n\r\n**On tackle Jared Gaither’s performance against Kansas City:**\r\n\r\n“He played well but I think that he would be the best one to ask because he has some things that he wants to correct and improve on just like we all do. But it was great to have him back out there.”\r\n\r\n**On his rhythm with wide receiver Robert Meachem:**\r\n\r\n“This game was one of those where he didn’t really have a lot of opportunities. The one that he did have, I shouldn’t have thrown. But we are in good sync, he and Eddie [Royal] both along with all the guys we’ve added. But we’ve had games like this every year where it was the running backs. Malcom [Floyd] and [Antonio] Gates got a few but it was that kind of game. We were efficient except for the turnover. And it was good to run it 23 times and to get six turnovers. When that happens and you get a short field you don’t end up with as many long drives or yards but it obviously boils down to points.”\r\n\r\n**On the running backs contributing to the receiving game:**\r\n\r\n“That’s how it’s always been around here. If you look back to years past, Ryan [Mathews] and [Mike] Tolbert caught over 100 passes combined. So that’s nothing new for our backs to be a big part of our passing game, not just in protection, but in catching the ball. Ronnie [Brown] had two big third downs. Jackie [Battle] had a big catch in the one big drive for about 15 or 16 yards. Ryan [Mathews] had a few there in the last drive. The backs all catch the ball well.”\r\n\r\n**On how the Chief’s defended tight end Antonio Gates:**\r\n\r\n“We knew that’s what we were going to get and they mix it on third down. So we had opportunities to get him the ball on first and second down. We were able to do that on a couple of those drives. And on third down what they’re going to try to do is get two guys on him at the line and make it hard for him to get off. There aren’t completions in the stat book, but to me, he had two catches in the first drive. They were both incomplete because of the pass interference, but the defender obviously felt like they were going to be catches and he went and grabbed him. Those were big plays. They don’t count, but they do count yardage-wise. It was good to Gates going and in a flow.”\r\n\r\n**On the possible psychological impact on running back Ryan Mathews not getting as many reps:**\r\n\r\n“It didn’t seem that way from his body language and his approach. I know one thing, and that is he was fresh and flying around in the fourth quarter. He had some big carries and first downs. He caught a screen in the first drive for about a 15 yard gain which was big. I think that it was a nice mix of those two guys. I don’t know the exact carry total but I know they were both in double digits. Ryan probably ended up with more yards but it’s a good combination with Ronnie [Brown] in there on third down doing what he did. It’s a nice group and they can all be fresh. Jackie [Battle] is a huge contributor on special teams. I didn’t feel any lack of confidence from Ryan. He’s improving every day and you can’t overlook the fact that he was out for six weeks. This was his second game in and he felt a little more comfortable. That’s just natural. He played a big role in yesterday’s game.”\r\n\r\n**On whether or not who starts the game is relevant:**\r\n\r\n“I think that it matters with certain positions. Offensive line and things like that don’t matter because you’re going to play the whole game. But in our system and the way we intermingle guys, you saw how balanced it was. It keeps them fresh and allows us to let them do what we they do best both in the run and the passing game.”\r\n\r\n**On what the win against Kansas City says about the team after coming off a tough loss to Atlanta:**\r\n\r\n“It didn’t tell us anything new about what we already knew in the locker room. We knew that we were resilient and that we were going to come right back. It just reiterates what I’ve always said about this being a week-to-week league. The one thing is that we know we have to play those guys again in a month or so. If it wasn’t a six-turnover game it would have been a tight game down to the wire. That was a good team and a good defense. I think that we had the right approach of let’s get after it early. Let’s not wait around and get a feel for the game and let the crowd get going. It was one of those games where we weren’t in a bind and we got up on them early.”\r\n\r\n**On the New Orleans Saints being more talented than their record shows them to be:**\r\n\r\n“A record obviously means something but it means nothing when you have to prepare for an opponent. We know what we’re getting into with the Saints. When you watch the games that they’re been in they could be 4-0. And they had this Kansas City team 27-6 like we did. Obviously it got away from them and they could have very easily won the game yesterday in Green Bay. A record means everything in terms of where you’re sitting at the end of the year but we’ve been in the same position where we were the 4-6 team and the 3-5 team where we knew we were pretty good but we hadn’t shown it. This game is going to be a heck of a challenge. It’s a game that you love to play in but also one that you know is going to be tough.”\r\n\r\n**On the mindset of the New Orleans Saints:**\r\n\r\n“It’s been many years since I’ve been around Drew [Brees] but he’s treating today like they’re 4-0. He’s very steady. And that’s how you bounce back from a situation like they’re in. In a Drew Brees team with what they’ve been though, you can’t ever count them out of anything. We’ll get their best and we’ve got to prepare to make sure that we give them our best.”\r\n\r\n**On quarterback Drew Brees throwing a touchdown in 47 consecutive games:**\r\n\r\n“It’s impressive when you think about how many games that is in a row throwing a touchdown. He’s broken a lot of records in the past few years and he’s a heck of a player. I was with him in the early part of his ascent to the level he’s at. So it’s been fun to see where his and what a great player he is.”\r\n\r\n**On what he’s learned from quarterback Drew Brees:**\r\n\r\n“We’re so different. I think that every quarterback is just a little bit different in our approach to the game and the way we think and talk about the game. But then again you learn things and you take things that are just about being a pro. The way we prepared and did the same thing every week is the one thing that I took from the most. We could have won on a Monday night or been beat and he was going to do the same thing. His demeanor never changed. He could have thrown three interceptions and it was like he had thrown three touchdowns or vice versa. And I think that’s something that filters down through the locker room. I’m a little more emotional and it’s harder for me to keep as steady but that’s one thing that I did learn from him. I appreciated being able to watch him those first two years. The competitor in me wished that I had been playing from the first snap as a rookie but I do appreciate seeing it from the sidelines.”\r\n\r\n**On defensive coordinator John Pagano’s brother being diagnosed with leukemia:**\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know what he was dealing with last week and I saw how steady he was through it while getting the defense ready and continuing the regular preparation through a tough time with his family. But family is most important. I know his brother a little bit, but it’s times like these where you have a tight group that helps you through it. They’re tough and they’re fighters and they’ll get through it.”\r\n\r\n**Marty Schottenheimer and Keenan McCardell being nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame:**\r\n\r\n“I spent a few years here with coach Schottenheimer and with Keenan as well so it was a very small portion of their long careers. But my experience with both of them is that were a great coach and player. But it’s something when you’ve played with a guy and then you see him on that list. And there will be many more that end up either in the hall of fame or being eligible and in the finals. So being with those guys is definitely special.”\r\n\r\n**On the defense creating turnovers and scoring points:**\r\n\r\n“That’s why I was so mad at myself for the turnover. I hate every turnover but in a game like that I didn’t want to give them any reason to get back in the game while the defense was playing the way that they were. Our defense is certainly flying around and playing together with a lot of confidence. They’re also very unselfish. There are a lot of guys contributing on both sides of the ball and it’s fun to be part of it.”\r\n\r\n**On having the regular officials back:**\r\n\r\n“More than anything was the familiarity with the guys we’ve seen for many years now. It’s definitely more comfortable and there is more communication. You feel like the crew is on the same page. And the pace of game improved. There wasn’t a whole lot of discussion on every penalty that they threw. It’s one less thing to think or worry about. Not that we did that, but we know that these are guys who have been a part of it for a long time.”\r\n\r\n**On developing consistency:**\r\n\r\n“You just have to play better each week and keep growing from a preparation standpoint. You’re going against different fronts each week. It’s week to week but you have play at a more consistent level. That doesn’t mean you’re going to score like we did yesterday or create turnovers like we did yesterday. But it’s about playing at a level that gives you a chance every week. And we’ve done that over the years. The last few years we didn’t do it from a win column standpoint but we’re in every single game.”\r\n\r\n**On making improvements from last week:**\r\n\r\n“We can certainly make some things better. Those are the kinds of things you work on correcting week to week. You also have to understand that the game is not going to go perfect. You’re going to have adversity throughout a game.”\r\n\r\n**On having kicker Nick Novak back:**\r\n\r\n“You hate it for Nate [Kaeding] and how he got injured but at the same time you’re thankful that Nick hadn’t been signed yet because the way he kicked last year all through camp and into the preseason. We’re lucky that he was here in San Diego and available. He could have been anywhere on a Friday afternoon. And he was great. He seemed very comfortable and stepped in.”\r\n\r\n**On his feelings on the offense:**\r\n\r\n“We just have to keep growing. We’re not where we’re going to be in December. We’ll be better. But we have to win along the way. It was great to get Eddie [Royal] involved yesterday and have him catch a touchdown pass. We have to keep getting better. We’ve had the big numbers, we’ve had the 400-yard days and all those things. It’s just a matter of winning.”\r\n\r\n**<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inside linebacker Donald Butler:</span>**\r\n\r\n",

I was able to make a play and go in for the score. It really starts with the guys up front. It’s about guys getting pressure on the quarterback, him making an errant throw and me being in the right place at the right time. I don’t think that it was necessarily anything that I did. It was a combined defensive effort.”\r\n\r\n**On keeping their momentum going heading into the game against the New Orleans Saints:**\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to keep it going and it starts today. We have to watch film and correct the mistakes that we did make. And we have to get ready for a good Saints team.”\r\n\r\n**On the Saints being better than their 0-4 record:**\r\n\r\n“They have a very high-powered offense with a lot of weapons. We’re going to have our hands full.”\r\n\r\n**On the Chargers’ defense:**\r\n\r\n“Right now we’re playing at a very high level. The Falcon game was a little setback. We came out yesterday and made some very good plays and I think we can be very good. It’s going to be something that week in and week out we’re going to have to work on, but as of right now I think we’re all playing at a high level.”\r\n\r\n**On what needs to be improved upon:**\r\n\r\n“It’s all about consistency and I think that we’re haven’t been at a consistent level.”\r\n\r\n**On what was different in the Kansas City and the Atlanta game defensively:**\r\n\r\n“I think that it was creating opportunities. Whenever you can get that amount of turnovers does strides for the team. The offense fed off of us and special teams did as well.”\r\n\r\n**On defensive coordinator John Pagano’s brother being diagnosed with leukemia:**\r\n\r\n“It’s heartbreaking. We’re all going to be there for John as much as we can and try to help him get through this. I can’t imagine what he’s going through right now. Whenever you have a family member who comes down with a sickness it really touches your heart.”\r\n\r\n**On being an underdog against the Saints:**\r\n\r\n“I don’t even look at that. The next game is the most important game and that’s the Saints regardless of their record. They’re a dangerous team.”\r\n\r\n**On the Chargers’ defensive line:**\r\n\r\n“Those guys are doing a great job up front penetrating, getting off the ball and getting on the edge getting after the quarterback. As a linebacker, that’s all you can ask for.”\r\n\r\n**On what felt better, his interception or Washington upsetting Stanford:**\r\n “It has to be the interception. But it definitely felt good seeing my Huskies get the w.”",

Speculation and rumor are running wild.<br> <br>Tomlinson and Spanos have become close over the years, and the team’s owner called his friend Thursday to explain the process and everything the team must take into account in the months ahead.<br> <br>“We talked about the situation and I just tried to explain everything that must be considered,” said Spanos. “I told him we haven’t even started our discussions and won’t for awhile, so don’t jump to any conclusions. And I told him I would call him personally to make sure he’s aware of everything that’s going on.”<br> <br>Could the team do what was once unthinkable and part ways with its future Hall of Fame running back, a player whose list of accomplishments is long but whose time on the field may be running short?<br> <br>“I wish we knew the answers to all of these questions now, but we don’t,” said General Manager A.J. Smith. “We want our evaluation process to be as thorough as possible. We always start with open minds and with the same goal every year: put together the team that gives us the best chance to bring a championship to San Diego.”<br> <br>According to the NFL calendar, teams cannot release players until Feb. 9, can’t designate Franchise Players until Feb. 19 and can’t make trades until Feb. 27. <br> <br>That is why the team, according to Smith, takes this time to assess its position and options. It also provides enough time for the dust to settle on an emotional ending to a season and assure its judgments are based on solid facts for the future and not on the intense disappointment following a season unfulfilled.<br> <br>“It’s important that we take the time necessary and get input from all of our coaches and personnel people and don’t make rash decisions,” said Smith.<br>",

            "Content": " <br>The long drive left the Chargers trailing by just 11 points, hardly an insurmountable lead. The Bolts got a little optimism with Miller’s touchdown catch was followed by a 63-yard kickoff return by Darren Sproles that put the Chargers on Pittsburgh’s 23 yard line. <br> <br>That hope was quickly dashed. On the first play of the drive, Rivers fired to his left to a wide-open Chris Chambers. Unfortunately, the pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and ultimately intercepted by Larry Foote.<br> <br>“You can’t really call it a fluke,” Rivers said. “They made a play, but it’s almost uncontrollable.” <br> <br>Eight plays later, the Steelers were forced to punt, but another strange bounce kept the peculiar series of events going down a disheartening path for the Chargers. Mitch Berger’s high, short kick bounced off the helmet of an unsuspecting Weddle. William Gay recovered for Pittsburgh, keeping the Bolts’ offense to watch from the sideline for another three minutes.<br> <br>“It’s a freak play,” Weddle said. “It was just such a short punt. When I was running I looked back at Sproles and he was a ways from there. My first thought was, ‘He’s going to catch it. I’m going to get to my guy now.’ As soon as I got my hands engaged, it hit me.”<br> <br>The Steelers didn’t score on the drive. They were actually stopped on 4th-and-goal from the San Diego one, but the damage had been done. They had an 11-point lead going into the fourth quarter and had exhausted the Bolts’ defense.<br> <br>“We know how explosive (our offense) can be,” defensive end Luis Castillo said. “We just keep thinking if we give them a chance, there’s no doubt in anybody’s mind they can go out and make something special happen. We couldn’t get off the field.”<br> <br>They were able to run the ball well and establish the play-action. When you let a team like that get going on that kind of roll, it’s hard to stop them. Give them credit. They’re a great team.<br> <br>While the defense was frustrated they couldn’t get off the field, the offense felt helpless not being on it.<br> <br>“It was such a weird third quarter,” Rivers said. “It had a huge impact on the game.”<br>",

            "Content": "  \r\nHampered by injuries to star running back LaDainian Tomlinson and other key players and suffering through a series of heartbreaking losses, the Chargers began the 2008 season with just four wins in their first twelve games.  With three weeks to go in the regular season, they trailed the division-leading [Denver Broncos](http://www.denverbroncos.com) by three games. Though their fans remained loyal and the team remained confident, few outside observers gave them any chance of reaching the NFL playoffs.  \r\n\r\nOver the next five weeks, though, the Chargers made an amazing run.  Beginning on December 4th, three consecutive San Diego victories and two Denver losses left the Chargers just one game back entering a December 28th showdown with the Broncos.  \r\n\r\nIn the decisive game, the Chargers staged an awe-inspiring offensive display to crush the Broncos 52-21 and win the AFC Western Division championship.  They became the first team in NFL history to have been 4-8 and make the playoffs and the first team ever to win their division after being three games behind the leaders with three games to play.  \r\n\r\nSix days later, on January 3rd, the Chargers faced a terrific [Indianapolis Colts](http://www.colts.com/) team in the playoffs.  In perhaps the greatest NFL game ever played in San Diego, the Chargers beat the Colts in overtime, 23-17.  \r\n\r\nEvery playoff tournament ends sadly for every team but one.  Last Sunday, on a snowy day in Pittsburgh, the mighty Steelers ended the Chargers season.  \r\n\r\nBut nothing can dim the luster of the Chargers’ late-season run.  Their dramatic turnaround is an inspiration to sports fans everywhere.  \r\n\r\nMr. President, I grew up in Brooklyn, in the shadow of Ebbets Field, where baseball fans endured years of frustration with the annual cry of “Wait Till Next Year.” When I was in high school, our dream finally came true, and “next year” became this year.  \r\n\r\nWith a talented young team that has triumphed over adversity, the San Diego Chargers can look forward to next year with pride and confidence.  I salute the Charger players, coaches, staff, and ownership – along with their loyal fans – for a great 2008 season.<br>",

            "Content": "**Transcripts from San Diego Chargers**<br>**Wednesday, Dec. 24, 2008**<br> <br>**<u>Head Coach Norv Turner</u>**<br> <br>“It’s been 14 games ago, you’ve seen guys and the way they’ve grown and gotten better. I don’t think Denver is giving up as many big plays on defense as they did the first time we played them. They’ve got guys who have been together and played together, they’re playing better team defense and offensively they’re first or second in the league in a number of categories. They’re explosive and they’re skilled guys play with great confidence and they’re explosive players.”<br> <br>**Is your team peaking?**<br>“Well we played extremely well against Tampa on Sunday so I think if you’re peaking, you have to do that two weeks in a row so hopefully we’ll do it Sunday night and then we’ll start talking about that.”<br> <br>**What did you learn about this team after the last few weeks?**<br>“I think it goes back a lot further than that. We’ve had ups and downs all year and we’ve had a lot of different scenarios in terms of winning or losing close games. You asked me what I learned and I learned it last year as we went through the season and I think that experience helps you keep competing and going and making plays. Obviously the key game for us was the Kansas City game, coming back with 4:50 left being down by two scores and finding a way to win that game.”<br> <br>**On the call that Hochuli made in Week 2:**<br>“I don’t even get involved in it because I had been involved with a number of those on different stops in my career and as I said, once it happens it’s gone and you can’t ever get it back. We’re fortunate to be in the position that we’re in and it’s going to be a heck of a game. They’re an extremely explosive team. They’ve got very good athletes in all three phases and we’re going to have to play our best.”<br> <br>**Is that easier said than done, letting go of something like that?**<br>“Yes, I mean, if you believed me when I said that I could sell you some other things. You can’t let it go, but you have to. You have to put it behind you and you can’t let it effect what you’re doing in the future.”<br> <br>**Is this defense better prepared to handle Brandon Marshall the second time around?**<br>“Well, we played better in the second half against their offense. Obviously the first half was really, really a struggle up there. You have to understand that those guys are awfully good and they are going to make plays. We have to contain them and if they make a big play we have to line up the next play and make sure they don’t get two in a row. They’ve made big plays in every game they’ve played so you’re not going to shut any of those guys down we just need to tame the best we can. I think tackling is going to be a big key for us as well as getting a lot of guys the ball and hopefully being able to create some turnovers.”<br> <br> <br>**<u>Quarterback Philip Rivers</u>**<br> <br>**Are there some hard feelings between you and Jay Cutler?**<br>“No, there really isn’t.  It got a lot of attention about a year ago actually, but there’s really nothing there.”<br> <br>**What’s different about the Broncos from the team you faced in Week 2?**<br>“Obviously they’ve had a lot of unfortunate injuries so you see a lot of different guys in the lineup.  They’ve haven’t had the same 11 on the field for a long period of time.  Other than that, they’re playing a lot of the same stuff.  It comes down to one game, so you’ve got to prepare for anything.”<br> <br>**Why do you think the rivalry between you and Cutler has drawn so much attention?**<br>“It’s exciting.  First off, Chargers-Broncos (game) is exciting every year, especially the last couple.  We’ve been battling for the division.  You’re always looking for match-ups to throw things in the mix but I know one thing and I know Jay feels the same way: we’re not playing one another out there.  We’ve both got tough defenses to worry about and we’re trying to help both of our teams advance into the playoffs.”<br> <br>**What did you ask for for Christmas?**<br>“Nothing.  I’ve felt like I’ve just about got everything.  I feel fortunate.  I don’t really have a lot of wants and needs.  It’s about the kids at this point.”<br> <br>**What was your favorite gift you received as a child?**<br>“I have a lot.  You obviously always remember a bicycle I guess you got.  For me, probably my favorite was I had a basketball court in the back that got paved and painted the lines on it and everything.  That was probably the one that sticks out the most.”<br> <br>**Is this team peaking at the right time?**<br>“I hope so.  Again, I think we’ve played good sporadically all year long.  We lost a lot of close games.  I don’t think we’ve been that far off, I don’t think we’re all of the sudden there.  We’re still sitting at 7-8 and have battled and won three in a row.  Hopefully we’re going to continue to play better and we’ll have a chance to play better into January.”<br> <br>**Has it been hard to get over the Ed Hochuli call in the Week 2 game?**<br>“Somewhat, but you’ve got to move on to the game next week.  I think as players, thinking back to how we handled it, we can really only worry about what we could have controlled differently.  There’s plays obviously as you watch that tape, individually and collectively we could have done differently that would have not caused it to come down to a call.  I know much has been made about it.  I’ve heard a lot about it this week.  I don’t really think it’s in anybody’s minds at this point.  We’re just excited to have the opportunity.  We’ve got one game to win the division.”<br> <br>**Do you think you feel differently about it because now it does matter?**<br>“Honestly, the fact that it was in Week 2, it was so long ago, we’ve had so many tough losses and close games and opportunities to get it turned around, I really don’t think anybody hung their hat on that one game and tried to blame a season on that one game.  We fought and scratched and battled and got to the point we are now to give ourselves a chance.”<br> <br>**What have you learned about this team in the last three weeks?**<br>“I think going back three weeks, remembering some of the things we were talking about here was, ‘We’ll find out.’  We talk about what a close-knit group we’ve got, a high character group with good leadership and a good group of guys.  It’s easy when it’s 14-2 and you win (six) in a row last year to finish the season.  That’s when it’s easy to be a good teammate and all those things, but we really got tested this year.  I think all we did was prove to ourselves and hopefully to a lot people that we are who we thought we were.  Now all we’ve done is put ourselves in a position.  We haven’t done anything.  The one thing we’ve got to understand is we’ve done nothing.  We’re still 7-8.  We just now have been given an opportunity to go accomplish what we set out to early in the year.”<br> <br>**What does it say about a division when a 7-8 team and an 8-7 team are playing for a playoff spot?**<br>“I don’t know.  It says the two things at the top have been inconsistent really.  Denver has lost some tough games as well as we have.  We’ve won some big games.  You hear about how not very good the AFC West is but yet we’ve beat a lot of teams in some other conferences that are at the top of their divisions as well.  You think back to New England and the Jets and some of those teams that we’ve played and won. I know it’s two teams that are capable, that’s for sure.  It’ll be exciting, two teams that obviously are good enough to win the division because we’re in the position.  Regardless of record I think it’s clear that we are the two best teams in the division, right there at the top and it’s good that it’s going to get to come down to being decided out there on the field.”<br> <br>**Are the Broncos now a bigger rival for the Chargers than the Raiders?**<br>“It’s probably that way anyway.  That’s no slight to Oakland, but the past couple of years, even though some of the games have been close, we’ve beat Oakland pretty consistently.  Denver, it’s always a tough game every year.  It seems every year us and them are going to be battling for a division.  It’s turned into a good rival and it will continue to be one.  There are a lot of young players on that team.  They’ve struggled with injuries.  They’re only going to get better in time and we feel like we’re a team that’s continuing to grow, that’s going to be hopefully battling for a division every year.  I think there will be nothing but more and more exciting games and matchups with these two teams just like it will be here on Sunday.<br> <br> <br>**<u>Linebacker Stephen Cooper</u>**<br> <br>**Can you tell us about the bad blood between the two teams? Has it intensified over the last couple weeks?**<br>“Yes, it has intensified but that’s because they’re an AFC West opponent. We’ve been battling the last couple years in who is going to win the AFC West and it’s been a battle between us and Denver and that’s why it’s become a rivalry game. ”<br> <br>**Do you think there is more of a rivalry with them than the Raiders?**<br>“People build it up to be like that because they have a great quarterback and we have a great quarterback. At the end of the day, it’s 11 guys going out there trying to do a great job and win the AFC West.”<br> <br>**What’s different about this Denver team?**<br>“Well, they’re not playing at high level right now but it’s for the title. It’s to go in the playoffs. Jake Cutler is one of the best in the league. He’s going into the Pro Bowl. Brandon Marshall is one of the premier wide receivers. We’re going to go out there as a defense and prevent them from scoring. Our offense can put up points but we have to do a great job in all three aspects.”<br> <br>**On if the team is on a roll:**<br>“I think so. I think we’re playing well. We finally put together a whole game on special teams, offense and defense. We put up 41 points. We prevented them from scoring and we did a good job on special teams. If we can carry that over, I think we will be successful.”<br> <br>**What do you have to do as a defense to help ?**<br>“We have to play physical. We have to go out there and stop the game like we did in Tampa. Our offense gets seven points and our defense gets a three and out. We have to control the field position with our special teams.”<br> <br>**On your play:**<br>“It has a lot to do with our defensive coordinator putting me in good position. Guys like Shaun Phillips and Antoine Applewhite getting to the quarterback. Three of my interceptions came off pressure from them. A lot of guys have been talking about that all year long to get pressure on the quarterback. We’ve been doing that as of late.”<br> <br> **What are you asking for Christmas?**<br>“A win over Denver.”<br> <br>**As kid, what was a memorable gift?**<br>“My first bike when I was seven years old. I remember seeing my mom bringing into the house about midnight and she said it was from Santa Claus. I believed it. I know Santa Claus is coming again and I hope he brings me a victory.”<br> <br>**What have you learned about this team?**<br>“You never give up. The guys stuck together the whole time and we play with a lot of confidence as you could see in Kansas City. We almost let one get away especially going to Arrowhead and playing in that environment. It’s tough. I think we did a good job as a team. Our offense did a good job of getting 14 points in the last four minutes.”<br> <br>**On LT’s talk after the Atlanta loss:**<br>“When ever LT opens his mouth, it always gets our attention. He doesn’t really open up his mouth too much. He lets his play speak for himself. When LT speaks, we have to listen because he’s a leader of our team. He came in at the end of that game and he said ‘Guys we’re going to turn it around. We’re not going to give up.’ That’s what we’re doing.”<br> <br>**On how Ron Rivera has affected the defense:**<br>“He’s doing a great job making it simple. He’s letting us go out there and play defense. We’re not worrying about checking out defenses. We’re just going out there and making plays.”<br> <br> <br>**<u>Running Back </u><u>LaDainian Tomlinson</u>**<br> <br>**Why aren’t you wearing any TCU clothing?**<br>“We act like we’ve been there before (laughing).”<br> <br>**How exciting was it to watch the Poinsettia Bowl? **<br>“It was pretty exciting to watch, especially with how big of a game everybody was talking about it being.  It was a big game because of the hype of the game, Boise being undefeated, everybody talking about they possibly could have been in a BCS game.  TCU could have been in a BCS game.  It was a big game and we knew we had a lot to prove and wanted to give Boise State their first loss.  It was a great win and I was happy to be there.”<br> <br>**Were you the honorary coach for TCU?**<br>“I guess it’s a tradition now, when they come out here they always put my locker up in the coaches’ locker room.  I would rather be in the players’ locker room, but the coaches’ locker room is good enough.  Since I was an honorary coach, I did say something to the team before the game, so I would like to say my talk helped them out.”<br> <br>**What’s different about Denver now from the team you faced in Week 2?**<br>“They’ve had a couple of injury problems obviously on defense.  Some of their key guys have been out in the middle part of the season, but I think they’re getting back to being that team that we saw early in the year.  It looks like the guys are getting back healthy.  They’re going to be a tough team no matter what everybody thinks.  Losing two straight, that doesn’t matter.  They know they need to win one game so they’re going to come here ready to play.”<br> <br>**Do you think the Chargers are peaking at the right time?**<br>“I think so. I really think we are peaking.  We had talked about playing our best football at the end of December into January.  It seems like we’re doing that.”<br> <br>**When you went to Denver in Week 2 you were battling the toe injury. How much different do you feel this time around?**<br>“Let’s see…this is Week 17, that was Week 2; about 15 weeks better.  I’m not worn down at all to be honest with you.  I don’t know where my carries are.  I don’t know if I have 300 carries yet, but last week I felt good.  This week I feel good.  I think by me feeling good right now at this time of the season, it’s perfect, especially if we win this game and get into the playoffs.”<br> <br>**How much different do you feel than at this time last year?**<br>“Last year at this time I was still healthy.  It was the playoff game where I hurt my knee.  If things continue to go like they’ve been, pretty much stay healthy, I like our chances.”<br> <br>**As well as you know the Broncos, what do you look for when you watch film?**<br>“I look at any new blitzes that they may be putting in, anything that they may try to do to kind of mix it up a little bit.  That’s the thing to me that over the years their defense has been real good at, bringing corners, catching you at different times in the game to cause game-changing plays on defense, coming up with stops when they need to.  I like to look at the blitzes to make sure that I’m in tune with everything they might try to do.”<br> <br>**Do you think of yourself in more of a blocking mode when Denver is on the schedule?**<br>“No, I wouldn’t say a blocking mode.  I’d just say aware.  You have to make sure you’re aware of what’s going on because with some teams you don’t really have to be aware of them blitzing and the things that they’re doing.  With this team, because they have so many people in the box a lot of times, you’ve got to really pay attention to where the safeties are, where the corners are lined up, where the linebackers are because if they do happen to blitz somebody, you don’t know where it’s coming from because they all are up along the line of scrimmage.”<br> <br>**Have you come to the point where you now think of Denver as your main rival rather than the Raiders?**<br>“In terms of winning and losing games and not really dominating the series like we have with Oakland, yeah I think it would be fair to say that this is much more of a rivalry.  That comes with you beating them sometimes, they beat you and you go back and forth.”<br> <br>**Is there as much bad blood and extra curricular stuff between these two teams as some of the others?**<br>“There is kind of a little extra activity that goes on out there.  I’m pretty sure there will be a lot of that going on this weekend with so much on the line and two teams that really don’t care for each other.”<br> <br>**In the long run, is it fair to say that the increased emphasis on the pass has been better for you?**<br>“I wouldn’t say that.”<br> <br>**How do you deal with it?**<br>“It’s part of my job to make sure that I do everything possible to help this team win and if that’s doing more in the passing game then so be it.”<br> <br>**After the loss to Atlanta, you addressed the team in the locker room.  What motivated you to do that?**<br>“I don’t know.  It was something on my heart to say something to the team because at that time it looked like we were pretty much done.  When that happens, I’ve been on a team before where they have tanked.  They’ll say, ‘The season is over and we don’t really have anything to play for.’  At that point it was all about not quitting and staying with it, finishing strong and being prideful about finishing our work, finishing the season strong.  That’s basically what it was about.”<br> <br>**That’s not something you do that often, is it?**<br>“To me, I’m not going to get up in front of the team and talk a lot.  I don’t want to do that, I don’t want to be that way.  Also I think it gets kind of fake when guys hear you saying something all the time.  They kind of get tired of you talking all the time.  I feel like when I really need to say something, then I’ll really say something.”<br> <br>**What did you learn about this group in the last three weeks?**<br>“It was stuff I already knew about them.  This team is a never-say-die-attitude type team.  It’s a really unique team from that standpoint of always believing that they’re still in it no matter how far we’re down or how many games out of first place we may be.  This team to me has a knack for staying focused and really continuing to play football.”<br> <br>**What are your thoughts on the Buffalo Bills?**<br>“God bless them.”<br> <br>**Did you exchange text messages with any of their guys?**<br>“No.  I would have if Aaron Schobel had played.  I don’t know if he played or not, but that’s the guy I know well. In my mind I wanted to but I just kind of forgot about it and got to thinking about that TCU game.”<br> <br>**What do you want for Christmas?**<br>“A win.  That’s what I’m asking for.  I’ve got everything I need and want except for a win on Sunday.  We (TCU) beat the (Boise State) Broncos last night.  It would be good to beat the Broncos on Sunday.” <br> <br>**What’s your most memorable Christmas gift you’ve ever received?**<br>“My most memorable gift was a banana seat bicycle with the long seat. That was the first bike I had and that bike gave me a lot of trouble.  It put knots on my head from running into trees and stop signs and stuff.  It was my first bike and I remember it.”<br> <br>**Do you think Ed Hochuli is glad that this game means something?**<br>“I think he’d rather be part of it, refereeing in it.  But no, I think Ed, I really believe that he’s probably happy that this is a game that’s going to mean something, that whatever happened at the beginning of the year, it doesn’t mean anything now.  I really believe that’s the way he feels.”<br> <br>**No you guys feel that way as well, you have a chance to erase that moment?**<br>“Absolutely.  We can’t sit here and blame Ed for that call because right now it doesn’t mean anything.  We have the opportunity to make that go away and really for people to forget about it.  That’s our focus.”<br> <br>**Can you talk about the buzz in San Diego right now surrounding the Chargers?**<br>“It’s extremely exciting right now around town.  At the toy drive I had yesterday, I can’t tell you how many people were talking about this game on Sunday and looking forward to it.  People are really excited and I’m happy we’ve got that fever back here in San Diego.  I think that’s the way it should be around here. It’s a great sports town and hopefully we can keep that going.”<br> <br>**Do you feel you take more cheap shots against the Broncos than against other teams?**<br>“I take a fair amount of cheap shots against them and probably a couple of other guys, too.  That goes right along with the chippy-ness and the extracurricular activity stuff that goes on.  If that’s the way they’re going to be then we’re going to get our guys to do the same thing.  That’s just the way it’s going to work.”<br> <br>**Is that different from other teams you’ve played?**<br>“Yes.  Absolutely.”<br> <br>**Stephen Cooper just said there’s no animosity.  You disagree?**<br>“Yeah, he’s being nice.” <br>",

            "Content": " <br>“They did a great job on one of our gunners and when they got kicked back on the punt return there was no one there,” Turner said. “We know he’s dangerous once he gets started. That play was the difference in the first half and it was a big play in the game.”<br> <br>The second was the one Weddle spoke of. After the Chargers got a defensive stop in the third quarter, Pittsburgh’s Mitch Berger hit a high, short punt, so short that it hit an unsuspecting Weddle in the back of the head. The Steelers recovered the loose ball and although they didn’t score, it was another blow to a third quarter that saw the Chargers run one offensive play.  <br> <br>“It was just such a short punt,” Weddle said. “When I was running I looked back at Sproles and he was a ways from there. My first thought was, ‘He’s going to catch it. I’m going to get to my guy now.’ As soon as I got my hands engaged, it hit me.”<br> <br>The day did provide highlights in the kicking game as well. Antwan Applewhite and Jacob Hester snuffed out a fake punt attempt in the second quarter, which led to a 42-yard field goal by Nate Kaeding.<br> <br>The kick came despite Kaeding battling a sore groin, which kept him from kicking off early in the game. <br> <br>**Going in, coming out**<br> <br>Sunday’s game also swung on two possessions that blanketed halftime. After the Bolts went up 10-7 in the second quarter, they couldn’t stop the Steelers in the final minutes as Willie Parker put Pittsburgh on top.<br> <br>The Steelers opened the third quarter with a drive that covered nearly eight minutes and saw them convert three 3rd-and-long opportunities.<br> <br>“It was one of the most important drives of the game,” linebacker Shaun Phillips said. “I always try to preach that, ‘Come on, we’ve got to buck up. We’ve got to get this momentum coming out of half time.’ Those two drives gave them a little bit of confidence.”<br> <br>**Spectator status**<br> <br>For the first time in his career, an injury caused LaDainian Tomlinson to be inactive Sunday. After the game, LT admitted it was tough to watch.<br> <br>“I don’t know if you can really get an idea for what it’s like,” Tomlinson said. “Injuries happen. Everybody goes through them. That’s what I was dealt with and I was hoping that the guys could pull through without me.”<br> <br>Had the Chargers won, Tomlinson would have “tried to warm up next week” and participate in the AFC Championship Game. He’s holding out hope that he won’t need surgery to repair his strained groin but hasn’t ruled out the possibility.<br> <br>Prior to Sunday, LT was inactive only one other time in his eight-year career. That came in the final week of the 2004 season when the Bolts had clinched the AFC West and rested several starters. <br> <br>**Unifying month**<br> <br>The Chargers were quick to express disappointment Sunday but also took a bit of pride in their resilience. After becoming the first 4-8 team to make the playoffs, the Bolts learned a lot about themselves. <br> <br>“One thing I’ve learned is that we’re a bunch of guys that will fight with their backs against the wall,” Phillips said. “I’ll sleep in a foxhole with any of these guys.” <br> <br>Moments after it came to an end, the Bolts had a hard time putting the season in perspective.<br> <br>“It’s tough because we didn’t accomplish our goal,” wide receiver Chris Chambers said. “We did some good things and I think we grew in a lot of ways but there are 31 teams that go home disappointed and we’re one of them.”<br> <br>**Clutch again**<br>Two week, no practice, two big performances. That was the line for tight end Antonio Gates this postseason. A high ankle sprain left him questionable for both playoff games, but the five-time Pro Bowler fought through the pain and delivered. He led the Chargers in catches last week against Indianapolis and tied for the team lead with five Sunday.<br> <br>“I’m a competitor and I was going to do whatever it took to be out there,” Gates said. <br> <br>Gates opened the game with a 21-yard catch on the first play of the day and finished with five grabs for 59 yards.<br> <br>**Escaping pressure**<br> <br>The Chargers sacked Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger just one time Sunday as he completed 17-of-26 throws. <br> <br>“They’re a very good pass blocking group,” Turner said. “(Roethlisberger) does a good job of sliding and moving. They’ve got places to get the ball out. I didn’t expect this thing to be where we were able to get him off his mark every single time.”<br> <br>Roethlisberger was also aided by a running game that produced 165 yards and what the Chargers called an afternoon of team execution.   <br> <br>“They did a good job of max protecting,” Cooper said. “They were keeping seven guys in and running three-man routes. They did a good job in their blocking schemes.”<br> <br>**Deceiving numbers**<br> <br>Philip Rivers lauded the play of running back Darren Sproles, who had just 15 yards on 11 carries but never got much of a chance to get going Sunday. <br> <br>“The thing they did to him was keep him sitting over there,” Rivers said. “He was sitting on the bench and didn’t get to do much in the second half.” <br> <br>Sproles caught five passes for 91 yards, including a late 62-yard touchdown, and had a 63-yard kickoff return.<br> <br>",

During the club’s four-game December winning streak, the Bolts intercepted eight passes. They had just seven picks in their first 12 games.<br> <br>The Bolts took a blow when linebacker Shawne Merriman was lost for the season after Week 1.

            "Content": " <br>Jacques Cesaire had a typical year for the gritty veteran, filling in at different spots up front and serving as a more than capable backup. Ryon Bingham saw time at both end and nose tackle, and both he and Cesaire are candidates to replace Olshansky in the starting lineup should Olshansky leave during free agency. Ian Scott signed with the Bolts three games into the 2008 campaign and appeared in four contests. He’ll likely be in the mix as a reserve again next season. <br> <br>Despite missing the first four games of the season, Stephen Cooper had another strong year. He led the team in tackles and interceptions with four, more than any other NFL linebackers. Matt Wilhelm and Tim Dobbins split time beside Cooper. Dobbins saw the most extensive action of his three-year career and turned in a key interception in a win in Oakland and provided perhaps the biggest defensive play of the year, a fourth-quarter sack of Peyton Manning that gave the Chargers a chance to tie and eventually beat the Colts in the playoffs.<br> <br>Brandon Siler continued to be a monster on special teams and was a key part of three goal line stands on defense. Fellow second-year linebacker Anthony Waters also made his mark in the kicking game. <br> <br>Shaun Phillips led the team with 7.5 sacks while essentially playing out of position. With Merriman out for the year, Phillips shifted from his more natural weak side spot to the strong side and had 15 tackles for loss. Merriman’s return in 2009 will allow Phillips to slide back to the “Will” position. <br> <br>Jyles Tucker recorded 5.5 sacks while starting 12 games but is expected to move back into a reserve role upon Merriman’s return. One of the more pleasant surprises for the Chargers was the play of outside linebacker Antwan Applewhite, who played well in spot duty on defense and was a force on special teams. Marques Harris, who had 2.5 sacks last season, is an unrestricted free agent. <br> <br>In the secondary, Eric Weddle’s strong second half allowed him to show the promise the Chargers thought he had when they moved up in the 2007 Draft to get him. He finished second on the club in tackles and appeared to get better as the year went on. Clinton Hart battled injuries throughout the year, which created opportunities for Steve Gregory towards the end of the season. Second-year pro Paul Oliver also saw his playing time increase as the year went on and could see his role continue to grow. <br> <br>Cornerback Quentin Jammer had perhaps his finest season of his career as he led the club with 19 passes defensed. Antonio Cromartie suffered a hip injury in Week 1 that nagged him throughout the year and kept him from enjoying the same success he had in 2007. He looks to return at full strength in 2009. <br> <br>Antoine Cason, the team’s top draft pick, had a solid rookie campaign as the nickel corner and tied for second on the team with 15 special teams tackles. Cletis Gordon is a restricted free agent after seeing his most significant action of his career. <br>",

            "Content": "Moments after Sunday’s loss in Pittsburgh, linebacker Stephen Cooper called the season a major disappointment simply because it ended knowing another team will hoist the Lombardi Trophy in two weeks.<br> <br>After a little time to reflect, Cooper found plenty he and his teammates could hang their hats on. <br> <br>“There’s a positive and negative to it,” Cooper said. “The negative is that our goal is to win a Super Bowl and we didn’t do that. The positive is we rallied in the end around each other and came together as a team.”<br> <br>Monday was a reflective day for the Bolts as they went through their end-of-season physicals and had their final team meetings. Players thought back on the long road they took, one that included an 0-2 start, a trip to London, four last-second losses, a 4-8 record at the end of November and ultimately a five-game winning streak that put them within reach of hosting the AFC Championship Game.<br> <br>“This was the strangest of all the seasons since I’ve been here,” said quarterback Philip Rivers, who players voted the team’s co-MVP Monday along with Jamal Williams. <br> <br>“A lot of good things mixed in with a lot of things that weren’t so good. You’re never ultimately happy unless you win it all, but as the dust settles, there will be a lot of things we’ll look back, a lot of great memories from games, a lot of bad memories from close finishes but really a season with a bunch of memorable plays and games and certainly a lot to be proud of.”<br> <br>Several Chargers echoed Cooper’s sense of unity and pride of the way the Bolts hung together to create a memorable December. <br> <br>“This was a team that fought every game, even when it didn’t seem like we were going to even make it to the playoffs, win our division,” running back LaDainian Tomlinson said. “This team never stopped believing that we were an elite team in this league. I think that’s something that I’m going to take away because of the kind of guys we have on this team.” <br> <br>",

            "Content": " <br>They also shared in Cooper’s frustration over the fact that the season ended two weeks earlier than they would have liked.   <br> <br>“Obviously we didn’t have the season we wanted to have or expected to have record-wise and ultimate outcome,” Rivers said. “From that perspective, we fell short.”<br> <br>Monday included a few lamentations. The Chargers had a chance to truly do something special but Sunday didn’t play up to the level they believe they’re capable of. The Bolts committed two turnovers in Pittsburgh, struggled to get off the field defensively and had a pair of misfortunate plays on special teams.<br> <br>“Late in the year we weren’t doing those things,” Cooper said. “It’s sad to see it happen in the playoff game. We’re going to go back to the drawing board and work hard this offseason to get back to Charger football.” <br> <br>They also looked all the way back to the beginning of the season to a difficult first couple months that forced them to scratch and claw their way back into the divisional race. <br> <br>“The last two years, September didn’t go the way we’d hoped,” safety Eric Weddle said. “Doing it this way is tiring. We’ve got to be a complete team from day one next year.”<br> <br>Rivers agreed with Weddle’s assessment.<br> <br>“We got ourselves in a situation where we had to string eight in a row together,” Rivers said. “We had to play eight elimination games to win it all. That’s tough to do. We stump our toe one time in Pittsburgh and have a crazy third quarter and it’s over.  It’s hard fighting a battle up hill.” <br> <br>Once team meetings concluded Monday afternoon, players bid their farewells to each other. They’ll have approximately six weeks off before the club’s offseason conditioning program begins. Rivers and company will spend at least the next few days adjusting to a completely different pace of life.<br> <br>“The first couple days are tough because you’ve been in such a routine and such a focus for…20 weeks now,” Rivers said. “All of the sudden it’s over. It’ll settle in and you kind of get away from it a little bit and then you gear up and go at it again.”<br> <br>**Rivera to Lions?**<br>**** <br>Chargers Head Coach Norv Turner confirmed Monday that Defensive Coordinator Ron Rivera may interview with the [Detroit Lions](http://www.detroitlions.com/) for their vacant head coaching position. Rivera joined the Bolts as inside linebackers coach prior to the 2007 season and held that position until being promoted to defensive coordinator on Oct. 28.<br> <br>During the final half of the season, the Chargers gave up nearly seven fewer points and seventy fewer yards per game.<br> <br>“That was our spark in the middle of the season,” Cooper said. “Guys rallied behind him and played great defense.”<br> <br>Rivera has been a hot candidate for head coaching jobs in the past and even interviewed for the job that Turner received in 2007 with the Chargers. Cooper selfishly hopes Rivera returns to San Diego, but would be happy for his coach should he land a top gig. <br> <br>“Guys would be sad but it’s part of the business,” Cooper said. “Guys come and go, whether it’s players or coaches. If it does happen, more power to him. He deserves a head coaching job. He’s a great coach and a great person.”<br> <br>**Wait and see**<br>**** <br>Tomlinson hopes that a month of rest will allow his strained groin to heal, but he hasn’t ruled out the possibility of offseason surgery.<br> <br>“We’ve got a deadline that if I’m not feeling better by then, then we probably might have to do something,” Tomlinson said. “Hopefully we won’t have to because I think in a month’s time I feel like I’ll be feeling better.” <br> <br>Sunday was the first time in LT’s NFL career in which injury caused him to be inactive for a game. He said that he’s talked to other players who have dealt with his injury and successfully seen the strain heal without an operation. <br> <br>**Plans for ‘09**<br>**** <br>Turner said Monday that he and General Manager A.J. Smith would wait until a later date to discuss how the team will move forward this offseason. The Chargers currently have 43 players under contract for the 2009 season. <br> <br>Unrestricted free agents include guard Kynan Forney, guard Mike Goff, linebacker Marques Harris, center Jeremy Newberry, defensive end Igor Olshansky and running back Darren Sproles. Wide receiver Malcom Floyd and cornerback Cletis Gordon are restricted free agents, and tackle Jeromey Clary is an exclusive rights free agent. <br> <br>The Chargers will select 16",

            "Content": "After having two great weeks running the ball on the ground against the Broncos and Colts, the Chargers rushing attack met its match Sunday when they came in to Pittsburgh.<br> <br>During the regular season, the Steelers held opponents to only 80.2 yards per game on the ground, the second-lowest total in the NFL. Thanks in part to Pittsburgh’s stellar play and due in part to the way the game panned out, the Chargers gained just 15 yards on 11 carries.<br> <br>“They did a great job,” running back Micheal Bennett said.  “For the most part of the game they were up. Although it was tied for a moment, they got up on us and we were forced to go to our passing game.  We still had our chances, but there were some mishaps. You have got to give them credit. They played a great game.”<br> <br>With the Chargers trailing and points needing to be thrown up on the scoreboard, the Bolts were forced to go to their passing game.  They ended up with no rushing attempts in the second half and only 12 total rush attempts in the entire game. <br> <br>“We didn’t do a good enough job,” tackle Jeromey Clary said.  “In the third quarter we only touched the ball once.  The one time we touched it we had a turnover.  It’s hard to win a game when you do that.”<br> <br>",

We just didn’t do our job and we didn’t take care of our business.” <br> <br>Darren Sproles rushed for all 15 yards on offense but shined once again in the return game and scored on a 62-yard touchdown towards the end of the game. <br> <br>“We kept running outside zones and stuff like that,” Sproles said.  “That felt pretty good but we had to get away from it because we got down so fast.”<br> <br>Even though Sproles made a couple big plays in the passing game and had a 62-yard kickoff return Sunday, the Steelers were pleased that they were able to limit him on the ground.<br> <br>“We definitely did not want to get him going,” Steelers Linebacker LaMarr Woodley said.  “Early in the game, we did what we were supposed to as a team by staying in our rush lanes and not allowing him to see the hole and hit it.”<br> <br>The Chargers were held to 5-of-12 on third downs Sunday, which were regularly third-and-long situations.  Playing from behind and having nine or ten yards to go on third downs, the Chargers were forced to throw the ball.<br>  <br>Although the Bolts defense came up with a stop or two in crucial situations, the Chargers offense just could not dig them out of a deficit.<br> <br>“They made the most out of their situation,” Head Coach Norv Turner said.  “They opened the third quarter with a long drive for a touchdown.  We return the kick, the ball is batted in the air and then they have the ball until the end of the quarter. You don’t get a chance to get the rushing attempts.”<br> <br>Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers was sacked four times, thanks in part to the fact that situations made the Bolts somewhat one dimensional. <br> <br>“You try to keep it consistent,” Rivers said.  “You try to continue to work at it, but when you get behind 18 points in the fourth quarter, you have to open it up and throw the ball.”<br>",

After that, field position and special teams are such a big part of it. Our guys are getting primed, our punt team particularly. Mike (Scifres) is on a role and punting so well and that should help us in the football game. Then, when you have opportunities to make some big plays you just have to take advantage of it.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">   \r\n</span>****<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Did you guys exercise your East Coast demons when you beat Tampa?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It’s a late game. We’re playing an awfully good team. When I went back and looked at the first Pittsburgh game, we were on the East Coast and there were a lot of good things that we did in that game. It was an 11-10 game and it was a very, very physical game, it was a hard-fought game. They’re just an outstanding football team. I’m not sure (it would matter) if we played them on the East Coast or the West Coast. We know how difficult it’s going to be.” </span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Has being in the playoffs the last few years seasoned these guys?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Playing in them and understanding, to me, it’s not about the game as much as the preparation. You have to prepare to do all of the same things you do in a regular season game. Sometimes I think younger players forget about that the bigger the game gets, and they start thinking about all the other things that are involved. We’ve tried to keep a pretty even keel in terms of our preparation. Winning games in the post-season and having won games helps, but I think probably the thing that helps most is the guys that have been here long enough to go through those two tough defeats. I don’t know that you ever lose that feeling and I have reminded them a couple times of what feels like to be involved in a game like that and I think that is a great motivator.” </span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">  \r\n</span>****<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How was LT today?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“LT is sore. He’s in doing his treatment and those things. I don’t know that he’s a lot different than he was earlier in the week.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">If someone told you five weeks ago that Darren Sproles was going to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated, what would you have thought?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Five weeks ago. That was a long time ago. Nothing that happens for Darren or that he does would ever surprise me.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Is Darren preparing differently this week because he will probably get more carries?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No. Darren has always gotten a good percentage of the practice at running back because he plays a lot at running back. He’s played a lot through out the year at running back. LT couldn’t practice today so we’re giving his share to Michael Bennett, so I don’t think that part of it is a whole lot different.”    \r\n</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How much different is it for an offensive line to have to protect against a 4-3 defense rather than a 3-4?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It’s a big change. We’re fortunate that we practice against it on a regular basis but we’ve had a series of games now against a 4-3, so it’s a change. These guys are the best at it, Pittsburgh is the best at the 3-4, and they give you a lot of different looks. They’ve got two really, really fine pass rushers on the outside, obviously the defensive MVP of the National Football League and they’re very creative with what they do. It’s not like last week where you line up and the guy is rushing every single time and you have to block him. They do a lot of different things and it’s demanding in terms of our preparation.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What kinds of things set Ben Roethlisberger apart from other quarterbacks?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“He’s just a great, great competitor. We were fortunate enough to coach him and coach the AFC in the Pro Bowl, and he is uncanny at throwing the ball into tight spaces. He can put the ball anywhere he wants it on a receiver’s body, so if you have one side of him covered he can throw it to the other side. He’s got great vision, but the thing that obviously sets him apart or that he is especially gifted at is that he can move in that pocket and slide in the pocket and he can throw the ball to anybody anywhere on the field. Once he starts moving, you can’t worry about him running. From a coverage standpoint you have to cover the closest guy to you because he is liable to throw it to him.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What is your reaction to Vincent Jackson making the news for something other than football?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“We’ve handled that with the release. Obviously I’m disappointed. It’s something that is a league matter now in terms of evaluating his situation and what the ramifications are.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do you talk to your team about things like this before games of this magnitude?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“We spend a lot of time from the beginning of the season all the way through. The thing that I think that the league has done is that the league has programs and has done a great job of educating young player and veterans. They come in two or three times a year and talk to our players. We have in-house people that set up programs for our players, and being a father and having kids you’d like to think that you would never have to deal with something where a guy makes a mistake. As I say, we’ll handle it the way we need to handle it.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Will his playing time be effected?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No.”</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Did you have a meeting with Vincent individually?</span>**<span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I spent some time with Vincent, yes.”</span><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"> </span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span><u><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\" editor_id=\"mce_editor_0\">  \r\n</span></u>****<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\" editor_id=\"mce_editor_0\"><u>Quarterback Philip Rivers </u></span>****<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\" editor_id=\"mce_editor_0\">With Ben Roethlisberger coming from the same draft class as you, does that add anything to this weekend?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No.  We’re in the playoffs.  It’s about us trying to advance.  Really nothing more than that.  Tough opponent, tough team at home with an outstanding defense.  We’ll have our work cut out for us.  We’ll need to play our best game of the year to win.  I think we’re preparing right now so we can do that.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Are you guys doing anything special to prepare for the cold?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“There’s really not much you can do to simulate it. I think obviously we can get a lot of good work done with the weather like this.  We’ve always handled the cold just fine.  Obviously if there’s any precipitation, that’s when the weather can become a factor. Cold, once you get out there you deal with it and you go play.  I don’t see that it will be a problem.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Would it affect the game plan?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No, based on so far I don’t see that it will have an affect on it at all.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Does the fact that you played the Steelers so close a few weeks ago give you confidence?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I don’t know if it gives you more confidence.  Obviously I think what it does say is two teams that went at it in Week 11, now there’s even more at stake.  I think it’ll be a heck of a game as it was then.  We don’t think we played our best game then.  They probably feel the same.  It’ll be another close game I can imagine.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How do you balance protecting the ball versus being aggressive?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“You just go play.  I think both turnovers really from a mentality standpoint were not the issue, just a throw that got away from me and then really a good play in the end zone where maybe I held onto it a little long.  You’ve still got to be aggressive.  You understand as the game goes when to be more aggressive and when not to depending on what type of game it is.  There are two good defenses right now.  Our defense finished the season as hot as any ‘D’ and Pittsburgh ranks right up there at one in every category. That’s what you expect in the playoffs.  We saw last week what the field position game meant to us with Mike punting and Darren with some returns.  Certainly we know that’s a factor, protecting the football and getting some points on the board.  Again it will come down to the fourth quarter like most of them do.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do you feel like you’ve exorcised the East Coast demons after the win in Tampa?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I don’t see that as being an issue.  For whatever reason we did struggle.  The fact that we are playing later on, it being at 4:45, it’ll be similar to what a 1:00 kick is here for us, which is normal.  I don’t see that being an issue.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What do you personally do to deal with cold temperatures?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Really nothing.  Just mentally you prepare to be cold.  That’s about it.  I’d probably have on a long sleeve shirt.  Other than that you just go out and bare it and play.  When you’re out there playing you don’t give much thought to it.  We’ve all played in cold games before.  You think back over the years we’ve played in cold games that are probably colder than this one.  We all grew up in different parts of the country.  Some of us grew up in cold weather and are used to it, some of us didn’t as some of the Steelers players.   It’s not like everybody on that team grew up in Pittsburgh.  It is what it is for both teams.  You go out and play.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">If five weeks ago someone had told you Darren Sproles would be on the cover of *<span style=\"FONT-STYLE: italic\">Sports Illustrated </span>*the first week in January, what would have been your reaction?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I certainly believe Darren Sproles could do something spectacular to deserve being on there.  I probably wouldn’t have expected it to be in a Chargers uniform based on where we were five weeks ago.  It’s been an impressive run this far and an exciting one.  Obviously I know where the expectations were for us coming in, for our fans coming in.  They were that we’d be at this point.  Now we’re here and we want to capitalize and make the best of it, not just be excited that we finished the season strong.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Have you protected the ball better since the last trip to Pittsburgh?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“In Pittsburgh it wasn’t really out of the pocket when they got me.  I always try to be conscience when you’re moving around of somebody coming behind you or getting it.  Really the first Colts game when (Robert) Mathis got me from behind was one that…it’s that you never take it for granted or relax. It’s turnovers like that that kill you, that put it more and more ingrained in your mind.  There’s no quarterback that wants to fumble or throw a pick so it’s not that I’m trying harder not to do that, but certainly the fact that we have stayed away from a lot of turnovers lately has certainly helped us go on the run that we have.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How important is it going to be this weekend to establish the run?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I think we need to be able to run the football.  I think if you look at the last…since we’ve gone on the five-game winning streak we’ve ran the football.  I think it is key because it helps us in our play-action game and again we want to be as balanced as we can, especially when you’re playing against a defense like the Steelers.  You look and they’re almost number one in every category.  If you are able to put a drive together, you get down in the red zone and they’re one there too.  They don’t let people get in the end zone.  It’s going to be a challenge each and every possession.  We’re going to work like crazy all week and on Sunday to get in the end zone.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do the Steelers have an advantage because of the amount of film they have on Sproles now?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I think it can work both ways.  Obviously they’ve seen him more now as an every-down back, getting some more conventional runs from the I-back position.  At the same time, when LT’s healthy, (Sproles) comes in in more of a third-down role and all you hear is ‘Draw and screen!’ from the opposing team.  I think it can work both ways.  He touched it 35 times last week including the special teams and I think he showed you’ve got to be ready for anything.  This is the same offense with him in there scheme wise.  He can do a lot of things with the football so I don’t think there really is an advantage either way as far as what they’ve seen on tape.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">With this being your sixth playoff game, how is it different for you than it was two years ago?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I think there is something to be said about having some experience in the playoffs.  Just the type of atmosphere it brings, managing the week, managing these types of deals is something certainly to get used to.  It’s always easier when you look back, but when I look back to the 14-2 season when we had the home playoff game and got beat, you wonder if it was a little too big for us.  I don’t know.  It’s always easier after you lose a game to say that.  We did some things that were uncharacteristic of us in that game and there were a lot of guys on the field that had never been in that big of a game.  I think the fact that we’ve been in these types of games now, this is my sixth but there are a lot of guys that have played in a lot of big ones. You think of last year in Indy, last year in New England, going to Pittsburgh will be right up there, a similar type deal.  I think from a hype standpoint, playoff game standpoint we’ll be just fine.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do you ever study Roethlisberger to see what he does well?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I don’t specifically go find other quarterbacks to watch them.  As you’re watching the Colts defense or you watch whoever you’re playing, when quarterbacks pop up you do watch them and see throws they’ve made against the defense you’re about to play.  Just from seeing him on TV and coming out the same year, he does a lot of things well.  Most importantly he finds a way to help his team win games.  That’s the ultimate deal for quarterbacks, you see him up there in double-digit wins every year and right there in the thick of things as they are this year.” </span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"> </span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"> \r\n\r\n</span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"><u>Running back LaDainian Tomlinson </u></span>****<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\" editor_id=\"mce_editor_0\">How important is it to establish the running game in the Pittsburgh weather?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I think it’s important to establish the running game in any weather really, just cause a team can’t particularly worry about one thing, whether it’s run or pass. They’ve got to prepare for both of them.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What’s your status for Sunday?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Doubtful.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">For lack of a better term, how much does it suck to be in the playoffs and not be able to play?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Pretty much what you said, that’s how much it sucks.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">You think you’ll be able to push it Sunday, test it?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I don’t know. All this time I’ve been taking it day by day. I think, depending on the training staff and where they think I am, if they think I should, obviously that’s when I’ll try to push it. We’ve talked about it. That’s why they have me listed as doubtful is because the thing that I did last week, it wasn’t really… I couldn’t do much. Obviously, it’s not feeling much better this week, it kind of puts you in a position where you have to be listed as doubtful.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Have the doctors told you that it will require surgery?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I’ve had doctors say I may need surgery and I’ve had some that have said don’t do surgery. Of course I would want to get through this without having surgery and that’s why I’m going to take my time and wait and see if I’m actually going to need it, before I do anything stupid.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Have they given you an estimate on the time required to heal?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No, not really to be honest with you. Different people say different things. Obviously when you talk to doctors, anywhere from 4-6 weeks is typical, you know, I don’t know. I just always wait and see. Miracles do happen and I think we’ll just have to wait and see.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Last year you had to come out against New England. You’re injured again this postseason. Do you feel a little bit cursed?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“You know, it’s been a tough year, 2008, I mean, it has. The whole year, you look back at the playoff game against New England and got hurt there and this whole year I’ve pretty much been banged up. So it’s been a tough year. But at the same time, to me, I always carry it as a fluke just because I’ve played so many years and haven’t been banged up, haven’t really missed any time. But here I am the last year, it’s been hurt more than I ever have. Now I can say that I’m getting old and maybe that has something to do with it or I can say it’s been a fluke, which I still think I’m in great shape. I think I’m just going to have to wait and see what happens next year and the year after that and see if indeed it’s because of my age and I’m getting older.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Is there one play that you hurt it?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No, I don’t. Looking at the tape, it may have been that touchdown run, the last touchdown run where it kind of slipped a little bit going into the endzone. But throughout that process, after the touchdown I really didn’t feel it at all. Maybe it was because of the excitement, the adrenaline. But that next play I definitely felt it when I tried to burst.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">When you took that first carry in that last game, in the long gain, it looked like it was almost dragging?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Yeah it was. It was. And that’s why I said earlier that that game was just all pure determination of trying to just push it and trying to do as much as I I could and go. But it was clear from the first carry that I couldn’t pick my leg up and explode and it did feel like it was dragging.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do you compare your situation to Shawne Merriman’s attempt to play in the first game?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Well, not really. I mean, it’s kind of similar of trying to play, but that’s what guys, that’s what football players do though. You’re going to always try to play. Most of the time when you get hurt, that next week after you’re going to always try to test it, and try to see if you can play with it. Then from that point on, you’ll pretty much know where you are. That was the same way with my toe. That next game against Denver, I was trying to see where I was. I knew at that point that I could possibly play with it, but it was going to take more time. I was going to need the help of the other guys. But with this, this is something that’s a lot more serious.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What do you do during the game if you can’t play?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I help coach. I try to motivate the guys and help Sproles and Michael Bennett out with some of the things that they may be seeing out there and just try to encourage them.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What emotions are involved with suffering an injury this late?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">  \r\n\r\n“I don’t think anybody can know the frustration, to be honest with you. It’s tough dealing with it. I really sometimes just want to go home and just stay at home and lock myself up and not even go into public, just cause all my life all I’ve ever wanted to do is play football. That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do and you know, win a championship. And to feel so helpless, to be at this point where we have a chance to do it and again, I can’t do anything about it, I can’t play, it’s like I’m being punished for something. It’s tough to deal with.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Does it make it worse knowing that you’re not going to have that many more chances?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Well, I mean, that does have something to do with it because you know that these chances don’t come around that often. But what do you do? You just hope that you get another shot at it.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Should the Chargers win this week and you don’t play, do you still take as much pride in the win?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Absolutely, because, you know, it’s a different point where I’ve been here all year and been a part of this and helped them get to this position. For them to win a game, two games without me, you have to take pride in that because you still feel as much as part of this team as anybody else. If it was where I went all season and didn’t really play, that’d be different. Then I can say, ‘Well, I wasn’t really part of the team. They did it without me.’ But this is different. You know, I’m in the meeting rooms everyday, with the guys everyday.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">If someone told you five weeks ago that Darren Sproles would be on the cover of Sports Illustrated, would you have thought they were crazy?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No, no, not at all because he’s always been making plays for us, but it’s been in special teams. You never know when somebody’s opportunity is going to come. They’re going to take advantage of it and they’re going to get exposure and people are going to recognize the things that they’re able to do. So, you never say never. You never say that a guy can’t do something.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">In practice, what’s it like trying to catch one of Mike Scifers’s punts?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“(Chuckles) It’s pretty difficult because he can do so many things when he’s punting the ball. I remember when (Darren) Bennett was here and I always knew how tough it was, catching Bennett’s punts. But Bennett taught Mike, so that should tell you how difficult it is when he does the different spins on the ball and the different punts that he’s able to do.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Does Mike surpass his teacher?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“That’s tough, I don’t know. You’ll have to ask him. I don’t want to get into that.” </span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What’s your reaction when a player like Vincent Jackson makes the news for something other than football?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Obviously we’re all behind him. Vincent says he’s innocent. We’re his teammates and we’re going to stand behind him. It’s a tough situation to be in and I hope that he can get past it.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">When a player makes that kind of news at a critical time like this, what does it do to a team? Does it do anything?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Well, not really. It doesn’t really do anything. If anything, it really kind of makes you focus in and really understand that you’ve got to be on your toes at all times, that you can’t put yourself in those positions. You just start to realize things like that, so it brings you a little bit closer. Guys rally behind him, you know, rally around him and talk to him and make sure that he’s going to get past this.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Have you guys met as a group to talk about this?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“We have. Earlier in the season, the NFL has a program where we talk about the different things that may happen off the field, the different situations you may be put in as an NFL player, and we have group time and we have sessions where we all talk about that type of stuff.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How about this week?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No, we haven’t really had the time to really talk about it as a group. But guys are talking about it individually, together and making sure that we’re always on our toes and doing the right thing.”  \r\n\r\n</span>**<u><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Tight end Antonio Gates</span></u>****<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"> Have you been in a boot this week?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I had to wear the boot the first couple of days because of the soreness, but for the most part I’m able to walk.  I struggle with cutting and jumping with the high ankle sprain, but walking is not a big problem.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">As a Detroit native, how do you handle cold weather?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“You learn to deal with it. You go out and you play and you try to block that out.  Obviously with the experience of playing in the cold, we played there earlier this year and the AFC Championship Game last year we played in New England, we have experience playing in the cold.  You go out and try to win a football game.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Is it worse on the sideline when you stiffen up?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Because they have the heaters over there and you tend to get the heat.  Then you try to go out and you’re basically numb by the time you get to the line of scrimmage.  It gets cold.  It’s really mind over matter at that point.  When you know first go out there, you know it’s going to be cold and you get your mind prepared to play with the expectations that it’s going to be cold and there’s nothing you’re going to be able to do that.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Will</span>****<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"> you wear sleeves?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“No sleeves.  It’s mind over matter.  It doesn’t mean I’m not cold with no sleeves.  I don’t want anybody to know that.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Getting eight catches with a high ankle sprain, how proud are you of that?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I think I was most proud of our will to win on Sunday.  Guys were asked to make plays and were able to step up.  Defensively we just did a tremendous job against Peyton Manning.  Special teams were huge.  We just wanted to maintain field position.  I was asked to go out there and do a job.  I didn’t try to do more or less than I was asked to do.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">On the first-quarter catch where you got behind the defense, what were you thinking there?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I felt him coming.  Sometimes you tend to harp on your injury when you’re playing in the game.  Even though you feel okay, you try to protect it as much as possible.  That was just the perfect case where I was trying to protect my right ankle.  I knew they were coming up behind me.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What’s your status for this week?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It’s always the same for me.  I’m trying to do as much as I can to feel as close as I can to feel 100 percent on Sunday.  (Head Athletic Trainer) James Collins and his staff do a tremendous job of helping me rehab and getting me prepared to play the game.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Will</span>****<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"> you feel better this week than you did last week?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I was a little sore coming off the game.  Obviously that was my expectations and I kind of had to plan that if I was going to play I was going to feel a certain way.  That’s exactly what happened.  I felt really, really sore on Sunday.  I felt really, really sore on Monday and Tuesday and I’m able to walk around pretty decent (today), kind of normal to where it was last week.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do you feel a little ahead this year because you know how to handle it after what you went through last January?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Absolutely.  Just dealing with my past injuries gives me an advantage on how to deal with this injury.  I just remember trying to come back and run and do those different things on my past injuries and actually setting myself back so when Sunday was to come, I was sore.  Now I just take a different approach where I try to rehab as much as possible and try to get myself close to 100 percent on Sunday.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">When you look at LT, do you see the pain and frustration he’s dealing with?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Yeah, we talked after it first occurred and it’s kind of like déjà vu for us.  Putting yourself in position to advance in the postseason and then suffering injuries which (keep) you from playing at the level you’re capable of playing.  It’s especially detrimental to him because he if anybody wants to win a Super Bowl.  He’s put so much into this organization.  He’s put so much into the National Football League itself.  It’s just unfortunate that these types of injuries occur.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How will Vincent Jackson’s situation affect the team this week?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It won’t really affect us.  Obviously it’s over with.  It’s in the past.  It’s something we have to be aware of.  Needless to say, Vince is a very intelligent person.  We just move on from that.  We are a high character team.  We pride ourselves on character.  Unfortunately mistakes do happen regardless of who you are.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">   \r\n</span>**<u><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\" editor_id=\"mce_editor_0\"></span></u>****<u><span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\" editor_id=\"mce_editor_0\">Tackle Marcus McNeill</span></u>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do you have confidence in playing this team knowing that they only won by one point?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It has motivated us to go out there and compete because we really felt like we had a chance against them in the first game. We had a couple mishaps but we played them real tough. We plan on going up there and competing at a high level this week too.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How do you feel going up against James Harrison?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“He speaks for himself…AP Defensive Player of the Year. He’s a great defensive player regardless. He can cover. He can rush the passer. I might have my hands full the whole time, but I think the game is going to come down to which offense can handle the other team’s defense better.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">What was your experience against Harrison earlier in the season?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Everything you see. He’s good at rushing the passer. He’s good on blitzes. He’s strong. He can drop in the coverage too. I even had to tackle him one time last game. I really don’t want to do that again.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Do offensive linemen like cold weather?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I’m actually from Georgia so I really don’t like cold weather that much. It’s not really true for me. I’m going to try to keep my sleeves off this week. You kind of get a little more jacked up when you’re playing without sleeves and man-(up) through that weather.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Why does it jack you up?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“You feel like you’ve got a mental edge.

We just think it makes us stronger.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">It’s always cold for the playoffs?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It seems like it always is cold like that, but I got a couple extra layers on me anyway so I’m going to be all right.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Last year was cold in New England. Did you do anything to compensate for that?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I defrosted three days after the game. That’s about all you can do. You gotta man-up through that cold weather and when I get finished I’m going to jump into that hot tub some where.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Is the worst part when the defense is on the field and you’re waiting to get back on the field?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“That’s definitely the worst part. For some reason every time we go somewhere that’s cold our heaters never work. I don’t know it they do that on purpose to freeze us or not. I mean that’s the worst part being off the field on the sideline.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Why are the Steelers so hard to run against?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“You can see their front. They have a lot of good people. They have Harrison.  (Lamar) Woodley on the outside. They’ve got experience on the linebacker’s corps. They’ve got (Troy) Polamalu who covers and stops the run. They’re all around a good defense. They’re good against the run and the pass. I think they’re number one in both. We’re going to have our hands full on offense this week.” </span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How important is it to establish the run game?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It’s definitely important. If we establish a running game I think that will establish our offense a lot. We want to actually take control of the clock.  When we have a running game going we can control the clock, keep them off the field and keep them from making big plays. That’s what our offense wants to do help out our defense and keep them off the field. I keep my defense off the field and I stay warm. They stay cold and we all seem to like each other real well.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">On Darren Sproles being on the cover of Sports Illustrated:</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I actually set it up for him.

I know how that works.’</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">How many zone blitzes did you get last time?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“I’m thinking 16 maybe? I tell you what, the Steelers are a tough team regardless. They really play off their abilities for everybody to play around the field. You’ll see their nose dropping into coverage. You see Harrison dropping into coverage. That allows them to bring a guy like Polamalu off the edge.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Ever since the Atlanta game the O-line has played better. Was there anything said or done?</span>**<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“It’s just the fact that all these guys, everybody on the offensive line, continued to push. We knew we had the ability the whole year. We just wanted to continue to come together. Our cohesiveness on the offensive line really helps out our run game.”</span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span>**<span style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Did it take for all of you to be back in the line up to come together?</span>** \r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">“Yes, definitely. We play as a group definitely as the offensive line. It’s all five of us taking care of the line of scrimmage. I was out early. Nick was out early. LJ (Shelton) did a great job filling in. (Jeremy) Newberry did a great job filling in. But you know we also miss a lot of tempo and things like that. We came back and it took us a little time to get our rhythm back, but now I feel like we got it going and it’s really helping out our offense.”</span>",

            "Content": "The Chargers opened the season with a 24-17 win over the Vikings, overcoming a fourth-quarter deficit and scoring 17 unanswered points in the win. **Philip Rivers** passed for two touchdowns, including the game-winner to **Mike Tolbert** at 5:01 of the fourth quarter. San Diego’s defense dominated the Vikings, holding them to just 187 yards of total offense and just 26 in the second half. After the Vikings’ second touchdown of the game at 9:44 of the second quarter, they didn’t manage to cross the 50-yard line into Chargers territory for the rest of the game. The Chargers finished the game with 31 first downs to the Vikings’ 10, and possessed the ball for 37:17 to Minnesota’s 22:43.\n\n[Game Rewind: San Diego Chargers vs. Minnesota Vikings](http://www.pntrs.com/t/RUBKRUNGSUBIR0hIRkBISEtERw?website=49069)![](http://prod.static.chargers.clubs.nfl.com/http://www.pntrs.com/i/RUBKRUNGSUBIR0hIRkBISEtERw?website=49069)\n\n**Norv Turner** earned his 100th career regular-season win against the Vikings and received a game ball from the team in the locker room afterward.\n\n**Mike Scifres** earned a game ball after taking over for an injured **Nate Kaeding** and scored his first-career NFL points, including a game-tying 40-yard field goal with 10:05 remaining in the fourth quarter...it tied the game at 17-17...Scifres’ last made field goal in a live game (college or pro) was a 56-yard game-winner as time expired to give Western Illinois a 44-41 win over Northern Iowa in 2000 for a conference title...Scifres was also good on all three point-after attempts...Scifres also handled kickoffs and had two touchbacks...Kaeding suffered season-ending torn ligaments in his left knee on the game’s opening kickoff.\n\n**Antoine Cason** had a game-high two passes defensed...both came on third down plays to force Minnesota punts...the last gave the ball to the Chargers for the go-ahead touchdown drive.\n\n**Philip Rivers’** 335 yards were his most ever in a season opener...it was his 21st career 300-yard game and the 13th time in his career that he led the Chargers back for a win when trailing in the fourth quarter.\n\n**Mike Tolbert** scored a career-high three touchdowns, including a career-high two receiving touchdowns...Tolbert scored the game-winner for the Chargers on his second touchdown reception, a 19-yarder with 5:01 remaining in the fourth quarter...he became the third player in team history to have two touchdown catches and a rushing touchdown in the same game...his nine catches were a career high.\n\n**Antonio Gates** caught eight passes to move into third place on the team’s all-time receptions list with 537...he passed LaDainian Tomlinson (530) for third place.\n\n**Shaun Phillips** made a great play on Minnesota’s first offensive play of the game, tipping a Donovan McNabb pass in the air and intercepting it at the Vikings’ six...it was his fifth-career interception and led to a Chargers touchdown three plays later to tie the game at 7-7.\n\n**Ryan Mathews** had a career-high 73 yards receiving, including a career-long 37-yard catch.\n\n**Antwan Barnes** made two big plays in the second half...on the last play of the third quarter, his pressure on third-down helped force an incomplete pass and a punt...on the ensuing drive, Scifres kicked a 40-yard field goal to tie the game at 17-17...then late in the fourth quarter, Barnes’ 10-yard sack on third-down capped off a three-and-out and the Chargers offense ran out the clock on the ensuing possession to close out the win.\n\n**Takeo Spikes** received a game ball for his first game with the Chargers after leading the team with 13 tackles.\n\n**Corey Liuget** had a team-high two tackles for loss in his first-career NFL game.\n\n<center>[![](http://prod.static.chargers.clubs.nfl.com/http://www.pjatr.com/b/R0BKRklISkBIR0hIRkBISEtERw?website=49069)](http://www.pjatr.com/t/R0BKRklISkBIR0hIRkBISEtERw?website=49069)</center>",

Based off the 2013 results, the combined winning percentage for the Chargers’ opponents is .563, tied for the fourth most difficult schedule in the NFL.\r\n\r\nAll AFC West teams are matched against the AFC East and NFC West. As the third-place team in the AFC West, the Chargers draw games against the third-place team from the AFC South and AFC North (Jacksonville and Baltimore).\r\n\r\nHere’s the breakdown of the home and away opponents for next season:\r\n\r\n**Home:** Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs, Oakland Raiders, New England Patriots, New York Jets, Jacksonville Jaguars, St. Louis Rams, Seattle Seahawks  \r\n**Away:** Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs, Oakland Raiders, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Baltimore Ravens, Arizona Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers\r\n\r\nGame dates and kickoff times will not be determined by the NFL until April.

            "Content": " \r\n\r\nThe Chargers (9-7) ended an up-and-down season with a win for the first time since 2003, clenching a winning record and sweeping the Broncos for the second time in four years.\r\n\r\nThree Ryan Mathews touchdowns and four Nate Kaeding field goals helped San Diego overcome a 7-0 deficit in the first quarter and cling to a 33-28 win Sunday at INVESCO Field.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s a great way to go into the next year,” Malcom Floyd said. “If we would’ve lost it would’ve left a bad taste in our mouth through the whole offseason.”\r\n\r\nBrandon Lloyd slipped into the right corner of the north end zone uncovered and Tim Tebow’s easiest throw of the afternoon resulted in a 14-yard touchdown that gave Denver (4-12) a 7-0 lead in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Chargers responded with 16 unanswered points in the second, including field goals of 42, 45 and 47 yards by Kaeding, and San Diego controlled the game until the final minutes of the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nWith many of the remaining fans chanting his name, Tebow capped a 12-play, 92-yard scoring drive with a 6-yard run with 26 seconds left and the Broncos recovered the onside kick. But two Tebow heaves to the end zone fell to the ground in the final seconds to preserve the outcome for San Diego.\r\n\r\nThe Chargers relied on Mathews often. His 27-yard burst up the middle in the second quarter, a career long, tied the game 7-7.\r\n\r\nMathews set a new career high with a 31-yard scamper around the left side on fourth-and-1 with 7:55 left in the fourth quarter that gave San Diego a 33-14 lead.\r\n\r\nThe rookie managed season-highs in carries (26), rushing yards (120) and touchdowns (3), also barging into the end zone on a patient 12-yard rush with 2:34 left in the third. He fumbled twice but the Chargers recovered both.\r\n\r\n“I was impressed with what Ryan did today,” Head Coach Norv Turner said. “He ran physical inside. He ran outside. He’s got some work to do to understand that handling the ball is different in this league.”\r\n\r\nMathews, limited since Week 2 by a high ankle sprain, did not play in four games and missed portions of others, finishing the season with 678 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. He scored five times in the final four games of the season.\r\n\r\nMathews’ performance was enough to keep Tebow and the Broncos at bay, but the final score was in doubt until a final lob crashed into the grass.\r\n\r\nCassius Vaughn scored on a 97-yard kickoff return with 7:22 left in the fourth quarter to make the late dramatics possible.\r\n\r\nThe game didn’t have playoff implications, a rarity for Chargers-Broncos late in the season. One of the teams has made the postseason every year since 2003. But San Diego’s players and coaches balked at the term “meaningless” before the game and were able to find benefits to reaching nine wins on the second day of 2011.\r\n\r\nSan Diego started 2-5 but went 7-2 during its final nine games, overcoming a disappointment in Cincinnati last week to finish on the plus side. The win served as an emotional boost for a team upset with missing the playoffs for the first year since ’05.\r\n\r\n“(Before kickoff) was the low point certainly of these last seven days,” Philip Rivers said. “Losing to Cincinnati and being eliminated was tough but it didn’t really set in.\r\n\r\n“By Thursday it was rough. Friday was rougher and right before kickoff today I was so aggravated and fired up to go play a game I couldn’t stand it.”",

            "Content": "SAN DIEGO – Rookie running back Ryan Mathews (ankle) returned to practice Wednesday.\r\n\r\nMathews has rushed for 4.4 yards per carry this season but has been slowed by a high ankle sprain since Week 2 against Jacksonville. He missed the last two games and hasn’t practiced since before the Week 10 bye.\r\n\r\n“It’s big getting him back out there,” Head Coach Norv Turner said.\r\n\r\nThe running game has looked good the last two games with Mike Tolbert topping 100 yards in both. Tolbert (hand) did not practice Wednesday but expressed confidence he’ll play against Oakland.\r\n\r\nMathews has rushed for 382 yards on 87 carries and has 15 receptions for 92 yards.\r\n\r\n“His role hasn’t changed,” Turner said of Mathews, who’s started six of his eight games this season. “He just hasn’t been here. Obviously we need every guy that we can get going and we’re going to need Ryan as we go through this next stretch.”\r\n\r\n**DECEMBER HERE:** The Chargers turned their full attention to the [Oakland Raiders](http://www.raiders.com/) on Wednesday, which happened to be the first day of December.\r\n\r\nTurner is undefeated in San Diego during December and Philip Rivers is unbeaten in the final month of the year as an NFL starter.\r\n\r\nThe Chargers craft the player’s schedule with end-of-the-season health in mind, Turner said, but attributes the late-season runs to a markedly better turnover ratio.\r\n\r\n“I know what the problems were this year,” Turner said. “When you have 18 turnovers in the first (seven weeks of the season, I don’t care how many yards you’re running for, throwing for, how many yards you’re holding the other team to, you’re going to struggle and that’s what happened with us.”\r\n\r\nThis month’s schedule includes back-to-back home games against division opponents that the Chargers lost to earlier this season.\r\n\r\n“Any time you play teams twice you feel like you know them better and they probably feel like they know us well also,” Rivers said. “It really comes down to out-executing.”\r\n\r\n**PLAYING BIG:** Shaun Phillips may have registered his 10",

He got underneath him and knocked him back.”\r\n\r\n**SAN DIEGO SHOUTOUT:** During the Sunday Night Football player introductions, outside linebacker Antwan Applewhite said he played college football at “Brady Hoke University,” creating a buzz at San Diego State.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs went 8-4 this season and will attend their first bowl game since 1998.\r\n\r\n“Just giving a little shoutout to Coach Hoke,” Applewhite said. “He’s turned that program around over there with an eight-win season and winning (Mountain West Conference) Coach of the Year so I thought I had to do something to show my support to the program and that was it.”\r\n\r\nHoke laughed Tuesday when asked about the prime time mention.\r\n\r\n“(Applewhite) is a heck of a kid. I’ve met him a couple  of occasions; him and Atiyyah (Henderson, former running back) are very close,” Hoke said. “Believe me, my phone started going nuts. My brother (Bears defensive backs coach Jon Hoke) called from Chicago and said, ‘What in the hell are you doing?’”\r\n\r\n**ROSTER MOVES:** The Chargers signed linebacker J Leman and receiver Bryan Walters to the practice squad Wednesday.\r\n\r\nLeman spent four weeks on the team’s practice squad last season and Walters was with San Diego in training camp. The Chargers placed receiver Richard Goodman on “Practice Squad; Injured” with a toe injury and the [Indianapolis Colts](http://www.colts.com/) signed linebacker Nate Triplett to their active roster.\r\n\r\n**BLOOD DRIVE UPDATE:** Chargers Blood Drive XXXII drew more than 3,000 fans to the Town & Convention Center on Tuesday. The official total: 1,259 pints of blood donated, plus 1,851 pints donated the week prior to the drive during Chargers Mania.\r\n\r\nChargers Mania will continue through Dec. 4. Blood donors giving at any San Diego Blood Bank donor center or bloodmobile will get a free long-sleeve T-shirt while supplies last.\r\n\r\nVisit SanDiegoBloodBank.org or call (800) 469-7322 for more information.",

Along with tight end Tony Scheffler, who caught six passes for 67 yards in Week 2 against the Bolts, the Chargers know they have their hands full. </div><div> </div><div>“They’ve got weapons,” safety Eric Weddle said. “They’re not one of the best offenses in the league for nothing. They’ve got two great receivers. They’ve got a tight end that can run like a receiver and a quarterback who can make a lot of throws. We’ve got to bring our ‘A’ game.”</div><div> </div><div>The Chargers secondary acknowledge the challenge Denver’s second-ranked offense presents, but the Bolts believe they are a much better defense than the one the Broncos saw in three and a half months ago. </div><div> </div><div>“We’re different schematically,” Weddle said. “We’re more sound in what we’re doing, each individual along with the team concepts, what we want to do and what we’re trying to get done. Early on we were hesitant in what we were trying to do. I think right now we like what we’re doing. We’re making progress.” </div><div> </div><div>As the Chargers gather answers for stopping Denver’s potent passing game this week, they may find some in the film of the second half of September’s matchup.

Each thing they did with him, he’s been fine. I think he’s come back faster than anticipated. He’s a very physical player. He catches balls in traffic and unless he’s completely 100 percent, we wouldn’t put him in a position where he’s going to go get banged around.”</div><div> </div><div>Floyd suffered the injury in the first half of the Chargers’ win over Kansas City two weeks ago.

For the Chiefs, a lot rides on Sunday’s game including a potential AFC West title and number two seed that would give the team a first-round bye in the playoffs.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Chiefs Head Coach Andy Reid said San Diego is “a team that never gives up” and knows his squad is in for a challenge.\r\n\r\n“To do what they’ve done with all the injuries (they) have is amazing.  The kids obviously believe in what they’re doing because they play hard on both sides of the ball and on special teams.  That I hope people appreciate.  It’s not an easy thing to do or get done.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with Coach, totally,” affirmed Marcus Peters.  “When you have a quarterback like that who can put up numbers and who is a gunslinger and when you have a (future) Hall of Fame tight end, they’ve been doing it for a long time and you have to respect them.  You just go in with the same attitude.”  \r\n\r\nThe Chiefs know what Philip Rivers is capable of doing against them. Peters says number 17 is not only great in his own right, but great because “he makes those around him better”.  \r\n\r\n“You better not snooze at all with that guy,” Reid added.  “He is a competitor and he makes everybody around him better.  That’s what great quarterbacks do; you see it.  He’s a heck of a player.”  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Chiefs defense knows it’s essential to contain Antonio Gates on Sunday.  Gates is one touchdown away from tying Tony Gonzalez for most touchdowns all-time by a tight end.  As Reid attests, Gates is still a dynamic playmaker in his 14",

I just love watching him other than when we have to play him.”\r\n\r\nOn the flipside, the Bolts defense looks a bit different than in Week 1.  Most notably, up front and in the secondary as Joey Bosa and Casey Hayward have turned in strong performances in an otherwise rough season.  \r\n\r\n“(Hayward) has had a great year.  I think he leads the league in interceptions and that’s pretty good!  There are some pretty good players in this league so he’s done a heck of a job. I think (Bosa is) one of those guys who gives (his all) every down.  He plays hard every snap and that’s what we’re preparing for.  He obviously has pass rush ability and skill because the sacks are the things that get the attention, but he’s a pretty complete football player.”",

That’s what great quarterbacks do; you see it.  He’s a heck of a player.”  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Chiefs defense knows it’s essential to contain Antonio Gates on Sunday.  Gates is one touchdown away from tying Tony Gonzalez for most touchdowns all-time by a tight end.  As Reid attests, Gates is still a dynamic playmaker in his 14<sup>",

Most notably, up front and in the secondary as Joey Bosa and Casey Hayward have turned in strong performances in an otherwise rough season.  \r\n\r\n“(Hayward) has had a great year.  I think he leads the league in interceptions and that’s pretty good!  There are some pretty good players in this league so he’s done a heck of a job. I think (Bosa is) one of those guys who gives (his all) every down.  He plays hard every snap and that’s what we’re preparing for.  He obviously has pass rush ability and skill because the sacks are the things that get the attention, but he’s a pretty complete football player.”",

Obviously I want to thank theorganization and Dean Spanos for me being back. It’s great to beback. My heart has always been with San Diego and I’m happy to beback. I love these guys on this team and never really thought I wasgoing to leave. I’m happy to be doing this right now. I’ll open it upto any questions that you all may have.”</div><div> </div><div>**How tough has this whole process been?**</div><div>“It was kind of tough, I think more so for my family because I hadto answer their questions a lot of the time. Any time something wentacross the screen I had to answer their questions, but I stillmaintained the belief that I would remain a Charger. They drafted mehere. I’ve been here for eight years and loved every minute of it. Ijust couldn’t see myself putting on another uniform. That Chargeruniform, that 21 with the bolt on the side of my helmet, that’s prettyspecial. You really can’t replace that. I’m just happy to be puttingthat helmet on again.”</div><div> </div><div>**Can you talk about your relationship with Dean Spanos and how that has evolved?**</div><div>“It’s just kind of happened over the years of knowing Dean and hiswife and family, going out to dinner and playing golf, just hanging outa little bit and getting to know each other beyond the business part ofit, as friends. Obviously I have a lot of respect for him. Relationshipbuilds over time. That relationship is something that has built andit’s been a strong one. I appreciate that friendship.”</div><div> </div><div>**Do you feel appreciated by the Chargers after this process?**</div><div>“Absolutely. It’s a two-way street. We’ve always said that this isthe part you don’t like, the business part of it. Obviously A.J.(Smith) has been criticized as well as myself about some of the thingsthat we both have gone through, but that’s a part of the business. Ihold no hard feelings to anyone. I respect A.J. for the job he hasdone, the job he’s continuing to do for this team and I’m going to tryto do the best job I can for this team on the field. That’s the waywe’re going to handle it. When we win a championship, everybody isgoing to be happy.”</div><div> </div><div>**Realistically, how close are the Chargers to winning a championship?**</div><div>“I think we’re very close. Obviously over the past two years we’vebeen hampered a little bit by injuries. That’s been the unlucky part ofit. I’ve got to figure that it’s our time. I’ve got to figure that thisis not going to continue to happen to us where we get so close and getinjured and really hurt ourselves in that way where we can’t be at fullstrength. When we’re at full strength, we’re a tough team to dealwith. I think everyone has seen that in the past. I’m looking forwardto being at full strength with this team.”</div><div> </div><div>**Did you at any point feel like you were close to leaving ****San Diego****?**</div><div>“I don’t know if there really was. From my standpoint, I remainedoptimistic about it. At the same time, I knew that it was a businessand guys sometimes go other places. For that reason, I kept it in theback of my mind that I might have to. At the same time, I had to thinkthat something would happen. As we kept continuing to talk about it, Ibecame more optimistic that I would be here. I kind of figuredsomething would get done and it did.”</div><div> </div><div>**How involved was Dean Spanos in these talks?**</div><div>“I’m not sure at all. I know when we first started going throughthese talks, Dean called me and said he wanted to talk about a coupleof things. I left it at that. At the end, he called and said, ‘We’regood.’ I was happy to hear those words from him, that ‘we’re good’, andI knew I was going to remain a Charger.”</div><div> </div><div>**Were you pleased with how little information leaked during the negotiation period and was that done at your suggestion?**</div><div>“Yeah, for me, I’m a pretty private person. I think thisorganization is the same way. You want to keep everything inhouse. Obviously we had a great relationship through eight years. Weboth kind of felt like the best way to do it was within us, two partiesworking this out. Then if anything was to happen the media would knowlater. We just felt like it was the respectable thing to do, to dealwith business between us two.”</div><div> </div><div>**Is there anything in this deal that assures us we won’t be going through a similar scenario a year from now?**</div><div>“Let’s just worry about this year. This is something thatobviously you deal with sometimes, but I don’t think it will be. That’snot something that I’m worried about. I don’t believe this is somethingwe’ll be going through next year.”</div><div> </div><div>**Do you have any guaranteed money out in the future?**</div><div>“I can’t answer that just because I actually haven’t signed the contract yet. We have agreed but I can’t answer that right now.”</div><div> </div><div>**Besides football, what are some of the other reasons why you really wanted to stay in ****San Diego****?**</div><div>“I think the most obvious is I’ve got a house here and my familyreally enjoys being here. We’ve been a part of the community for solong. Our foundation does so much stuff here to help so many people. Ijust really didn’t want to turn our back on the people in the communityand all the things we’ve built here so far.”</div><div> </div><div>**Did you ever feel like the Chargers were turning their back on you during the process?**</div><div>“No, again, I understand the business side of it. I didn’t feellike they were turning their back on me, but I felt like they needed tomake business decisions as any organization does. I never felt likethey were turning their backs on me. Of course there are times when youwonder if you’re going to be here. I never felt like they were turningtheir back on me. They had given me eight years, great years. Theydrafted me and gave me the opportunity. Not at all did I feel like theywere turning their back on me.”</div><div> </div><div>**If you’re healthy, how close can you be to the LT we’ve seen the last eight years?**</div><div>“I think I will continue to be a very explosive player. You guyssaw me last year where I was banged up all year, played with a hurt toeand obviously with the groin injury. I’ll be back to full strength andto being the LT that you guys are used to seeing.”</div><div> </div><div>**Did A.J. Smith explain to you the thought process inrestructuring your deal and were you satisfied with his plan for thefuture?**</div><div>“Absolutely. It’s to win, to get players here to help us wingames. I’ve never been a selfish guy. The more guys we can have here tohelp us win…I’m all about winning championships. We’ve come so close sofar but haven’t done it yet. I’ve always said when I first got to SanDiego that I wanted to be a part of something special and help bringchampionships to this organization and to this city. That’s how Iremain.”</div><div> </div><div>**Can you remain as explosive as you were in 2006?**</div><div>“Absolutely, with the opportunities. That was a special year, nodoubt. Will I rush for 1,800 yards again? Who knows. I think it’spossible, definitely. That’s yet to be seen. I think with the sameopportunities, it can happen.”</div><div> </div><div>**How would you describe your emotions today?**</div><div>“It’s relief, knowing where I’m going to be playing footballat. That was my whole focus. That’s very important. It lifts a bigweight off my shoulders and everybody else around you, to know whereyou’re going to lace them up at.”</div><div> </div><div>**When you signed your contract in 2004, did you know that this day would likely come?**</div><div>“I know history tells us that usually you do restructure sometimeslater into your contract. Sometimes you don’t get to. You end upgetting released or traded or what have you. I was just happy that Ihad the opportunity to restructure my contract rather than be releasedor traded.”</div><div> </div><div>**What was your wife’s reaction to the news?**</div><div>“She was happy. I could just tell. She probably read every commentthat each of you had written. I used to tell here to stop readingit. She said, ‘No, it’s not bothering me,’ but I knew it was. It wasjust a relief from here after it was done. I knew that she was excitedthat we were going to remain in San Diego. She loves it here and shereally didn’t want to move anywhere.”</div><div> </div><div>**Do you have any regrets about the statement you made on your website in January and the reaction that came out of that?**</div><div>“No. At that time I was starting to get a lot of notes from fanssaying, ‘Don’t leave,’ and ‘How could you turn your back on us?’ I justwanted to let them know that I was going to do everything I could toremain a Charger. My heart is here and I’m going to do everythingpossible to be here. That was my whole point in making that statement.”</div><div> </div><div>**Do you think you have to prove you can stay healthy through a full season and postseason?**</div><div>“Absolutely. I feel like I do have to prove I can stay healthy.I’ve always felt like I needed to prove something. When I first cameinto the league, I wanted to prove that I could play in this league andthat I could be dominant. I know I can do that. Going on 30 (yearsold), I want to prove that I can stay healthy a full season and stillbe that dominant player. Honestly, I haven’t had any serious injurieswith surgeries. I don’t see why I can’t continue to be a dominantplayer.”</div><div> </div><div>**Is there something you can do during the offseason to help prevent injuries?**</div><div>“I think you become smarter. You learn how to work in a differentway. You still maintain working hard, but you do it in a differentway. Not as much pounding in the offseason, kind of save myself alittle more for the season and gearing up for training camp and goingthrough the season. Before, I used to start off just going 100 milesper hour, and sometimes it wore me down. I was in such good shape whenI got to training camp that I really had nothing to work for. ObviouslyI think some of that will change, but most of it is going to stay thesame.”</div><div> </div><div>**Can you talk about your recent comments about EmmittSmith’s career rushing record and why for the first time you discussedmaking a run at him?**</div><div>“I think that’s something that I’ve just kind of got a new fire ofsaying, ‘Why not?’ If we’re winning and winning championships, I dowant to play as long as I can and walk away with all the records. Thatwould be a heck of a challenge and I’m up for challenges. I’m certainlygoing to try to do it.”</div><div> </div><div>**Now that the contract negotiations are done, when do youstart negotiations with Norv Turner about returning the halfback option?**</div><div>“We just got through talking about that to be honest withyou. Norv has told me that, I don’t want to give it away to all theteams out there, but you’d better watch out. It’s going to be in.”</div><div> </div><div>**What is your message to the fans that admire you?**</div><div>“I just appreciate their support, for coming to the stadium withtheir 21 jerseys on and just the Charger jersey period and supportingthis team. I appreciate that. I look forward to many more years ofexciting football and winning. I just believe that we’re going to walkoff with that Lombardi Trophy and we’re going to have the craziestparty in this city that we’ve ever had.”</div><div> </div><div>**You’ve previously said the Smith record wasn’t that important to you. What’s changed?**</div><div>“I think for so long I blocked it out. It was so far out there,but reevaluating where I’m at in my career now, I think it’sreachable. I guess I just kind of got the sense of, ‘Why not?’ Whyshould I at the end of my career look back and say, ‘I was this closeto Emmitt’s record. Why didn’t I continue to play and try to get it?’ Idon’t want to have that regret. I don’t want to have any regrets when Ileave this game. I guess that’s kind of what’s changed.”</div><div> </div><div>**Did you feel like you were shortchanged last year whenpeople wrote things about your decline when you were actually battlinginjuries?**</div><div>“No, you play the hand you’re dealt. For me, it’s good because Iget to prove what I’m worth again. I get to prove to people, and that’sthe way it’s always been for me. I’ve always enjoyed doing that. I getto do it once again.”</div><div> </div><div>**How do you feel physically right now?**</div><div>“I feel great physically. I’ve started back working out. This weekwas the first week where I’ve actually starting cutting and all kindsof things. It feels really good. It’s really good to be feeling strongagain.”</div><div> </div><div>**Have you negotiated any incentives into your contract for passing Emmitt Smith?**</div><div>“No I haven’t. I think sometimes the outside endorsements, you cannegotiate with that as well, with the Nikes and the Gatorade and whathave you. I think the Chargers are paying me enough money. I’m good.”</div><div> </div><div>**Was money much of a factor in this process?**</div><div>“To me, I thought being fair was what I was looking for. Not toreally try to break the bank or do anything crazy, but just to befair. That was all that I was looking for. The Chargers have alwaysbeen that, so I really didn’t think they wouldn’t be fair. When it camedown to it they were.”</div><div> </div><div>**Do you think the comments your mother made on the radio last week were a factor in this?**</div><div>“I really don’t know.

I’m thanking God a million times just to be a part of a first-class organization.”\r\n\r\n**What do you think you can bring to this defense?  \r\n**  \r\n“I’m going to bring the team a hard worker who is going to lay it all on the line every play for my teammates.” \r\n\r\n**Do anticipate making an immediate impact on the Chargers defense?  \r\n**  \r\n“Of course. That’s my number-one goal, to come in, work hard and try to make an impact as soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n**Do you think you slipped at all or did you land where you wanted to be?  \r\n**  \r\n“It really didn’t matter to me. Before I came to the draft, I prayed to God and I said, ‘I’m going to put my faith in God and whatever position you put me in I will feel it is the best for me.’”\r\n\r\n**Do you have a history with any other Chargers players?  \r\n**  \r\n“I know there are a lot of first-class, high-caliber athletes out there that I can learn from like Takeo Spikes and Shaun Phillips. They also have a wonderful quarterback in Philip Rivers.”\r\n\r\n**Can you talk about the general experience of being drafted?  \r\n**  \r\n“It couldn’t have gone any better. It’s a blessing and I’m thanking God.”\r\n\r\n**Is it your birthday?  \r\n**  \r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n**What did A.J.

Who helped you with that?  \r\n**  \r\n“I just try to look presentable.”\r\n\r\n**How about the handshake?  \r\n**  \r\n“That was something we made up. I told him that I wanted to do something different so we came up with the handshake.”\r\n\r\n**What was the difference between your senior and junior year?  \r\n**  \r\n“In my junior year, I played in certain packages and certain situations. In my senior year, I was a full-time starter and I had a lot more opportunities to make a lot more plays.”\r\n\r\n**What do you think you proved as a senior?  \r\n**  \r\n“I think I proved that I was one of the hardest-working players on my team.”**<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">",

            "Content": "HTML NO SUPPORTED : </sup> pick and selected (Melvin) Ingram, University of South Carolina outside linebacker. As a group, scouting staff, organization, we couldn’t be happier with the pick. We thought, going into the draft, Melvin was one of the most complete linebackers out of the group of players we scouted, and we feel happy with the selection.”\r\n\r\n**Did you expect him to be on the board at 18?**\r\n\r\n“No, and that was the great thing. In all the mocks (drafts) we saw; the stuff we did in our workups, we thought Melvin would be gone a lot early. We were ecstatic as he came down the board. And we were just hoping he would fall to our spot.”\r\n\r\n**On toying with the idea of trading up:**\r\n\r\n“We always consider everything. We thought about going up, of course. But we decided to stay where we were. As he came down the board we felt like maybe he will be there. We had a cluster of players that we felt good about, and when he was there we were excited.”\r\n\r\n**What did you see when you looked at him (Melvin Ingram) his senior year?**\r\n\r\n“The versatility. The pass-rushing ability. As you guys all know, we’ve talked about getting edge rushers and getting pressure on the quarterback for the last couple of months since the season ended. He is the type of player we felt like brought burst and energy and rush ability off the edge as well as inside, as an interior pass rusher. That type of versatility will bode well for our defense.”\r\n\r\n**Are you surprised it took so long for pass rushers to start going?**\r\n\r\n“A little bit. I was. You look at the New York Giants and teams like that, what they’ve done the past five or six years is pressure the quarterback and win games. We thought the run on outside linebackers and pass rushers would start a little bit earlier. That’s why we were so excited when he fell to our pick.”\r\n\r\n**On the comparison between Melvin Ingram and the Giants’ Jason Pierre-Paul:**\r\n\r\n“They’re different players. Jason (Pierre-Paul) is a longer guy. Melvin is more of compact, thick, more like in the mold of the Pittsburgh outside linebackers. Big legs, shorter in stature, powerful guy. In that sense I think they are a little bit different.”\r\n\r\n**On if the team entertained any offers for trades:**\r\n\r\n“We got a few calls, which is normal. Once Melvin started coming down the board and some of the guys that we had targeted were there we decided to stay with our selection.”\r\n\r\n**On how he thinks Melvin will fit in:**\r\n\r\n“Good. Coach (Turner) can probably talk more about that than I can. But we think he fits well in our group. We like the guys that we have. We have a veteran group of guys. We think Melvin as a young rookie coming in, he’s just going to add to that whole group of players.”\r\n\r\n**<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">",

            "Content": "Head Coach Norv Turner on Ingram:</span>**\r\n\r\n**Opening statement:**\r\n\r\n**“**In terms of the outside linebackers, Melvin (Ingram) is the most complete linebacker, we felt, this early in the draft. We coached the Pro Bowl three years ago, and it’s amazing all those Pro Bowl outside rushers are about 6-foot-2. They claim they are, but, they look like they are about 5-foot-11. They’re 270 (pounds). They have great leverage. They get under people. Jimmy (Raye) mentioned the (comparison to) Pittsburgh linebackers. Melvin is the body type of that. You can talk about a lot of different scenarios, you can talk about a lot of different things, but to me, we’ve improved a great deal as a football team through free agency. We improved as a football team today adding a player of Melvin’s caliber.”\r\n\r\n**On how Melvin will be used:**\r\n\r\n“You have to look back to when our defense has been at its best, and we’ve had multiple players playing at the outside linebacker position. One of the things that was really hard on our guys last year was that we had some guys play 750 plays during an entire season. The guys before them really didn’t have to do (that). Melvin can be an impact player. He doesn’t have to be on the field every down. He can fit in with the mix of the guys we have. He can learn from them. I think he is going to be outstanding on third down. He has rushed inside. Early, you don’t ask a guy to do a lot of coverage stuff like that. That’s kind of been the learning curve the linebackers have had here in the past as first and second-year players. You pick out the things they do best and you let them do them, and that will be our plan with Melvin.”\r\n\r\n**Was there a feeling of disbelief when he kept falling to you?**\r\n\r\n“Not in my mind. There were a group of guys there that we really liked. If Melvin had been taken I think there were some guys that would have been able to come in and help. As I said, we felt Melvin was the most complete guy so that’s why there was the anxiousness and excitement when he was there when we picked.”\r\n\r\n**On comparing him with the Pittsburgh Steelers’ linebackers:**\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know. They’re (Harrison and Woodley) both outstanding. Those are the things we’ll find out when we get him here. Both those guys are similar in that they’re very, very physical players, and that’s something you always want to do. You want to get the most physical players you can get. They’re very competitive players. They’re playmakers. That’s what Melvin is.”\r\n\r\n**Out of the cluster of pass rushers was Ingram your first choice?**\r\n\r\n“He was the one guy, if we break down the other guys that we looked at, as I said, (that was the) most complete. Athletic…pass rush…he’s gone down inside and played inside over a guard and created a matchup that’s outstanding. He’s probably the guy that we felt, as I said, (is) the most compete.”\r\n\r\n**On the excitement of knowing the player you want is there:**\r\n\r\n“Absolutely. You’ve got some guys in your cluster and they’re there. You know which one you want, but you’d be excited about any of them.”\r\n\r\n**Who was the next person in line?**\r\n\r\n“(Laughing) I don’t remember.”\r\n\r\n**Did you make the phone call?**\r\n\r\n“A.J. (Smith) made the call, but we all get on the phone with him. That’s one of the real exciting things about the draft. When you get on the phone with a young guy and he’s been selected. Melvin is in New York. Later we’ll get some guys that are at home and they have their family there screaming in the background. This is a great day for these guys. They’ve worked awfully hard to get to this point, and it’s the next step in their careers.”\r\n\r\n**On addressing a need by selecting a player on defense versus offense:**\r\n\r\n“Everyone has an opinion, but I think people are going to be excited about this pick. The ‘so-called’ experts, the people who evaluate players, we’ve gotten a number of calls from people around the league who have (a) great feeling for this player, so I would expect our people to be extremely excited about Melvin.”\r\n\r\n**How close to executing your offseason plan are you?**\r\n\r\n“As A.J. (Smith) would tell you, it’s an on-going thing. Like I said, through free agency, I think we have significantly gotten better. We’re going to continue tomorrow to keep working to get better. For me, it starts in May when we get on the field with our players and start doing the offseason work because we can improve a great deal. No question from an athleticism and talent level we’ve gotten a lot better.”\r\n\r\n**On if there is a concern with doubling up on a position with the first-round pick in back-to-back years:**\r\n\r\n“Not in my mind. You’re trying to get good football players. As I said, when this defense has been at its best, and I’ve coached against it, and obviously coached it, we’ve had multiple players at the outside position. We’ve been able to roll them in there; we’ve been able to keep them fresh. They’ve been different styles but they’ve all been very, very competitive, very athletic, and for the most part, very physical, like Melvin.”\r\n\r\n**On possibly drafting an offensive lineman versus Ingram:**\r\n\r\n“This was the right pick for us. I think people who really look at us know that the group of guys that played on the offense line the last five games and played with us healthy, played at pretty high level and they’re still guys that will continue to get better. We’re going to continue to look at players that will help us in that area.”\r\n\r\n**Does Ingram also fill the need for backup running back?**\r\n\r\n“I don’t think he’ll be a running back but that talks to the athlete that he is. I don’t know if you saw the fake punt that he scored on. He makes a move like a running back so he is going to be a guy – you want your young guys to be able to come in and help you in the kicking game, and there’s no question he’s a guy that will be able to play in all phases of the kicking game.”",

Prescott to Butler for 14 yards converted a 3rd-and-5 situation. Elliott broke free again, this time for 17 yards to get near the goal line.\r\n\r\n**The Cowboys rookie ball-carrier finished what he started, scoring from 1-yard out to give Dallas a 21-17 lead.

The holidays are always very special for my family, but also gives us an opportunity to help those in need and hopefully inspire some others to do what they can to help be a positive influence in their communities.”\r\n\r\nDawn Kruger, the CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters spoke highly of Kerley's efforts to give back.  \r\n\r\n\"Jeremy and his 49ers teammates are powerful role models, and they are creating a lifetime memory for kids who dont have may opportunities like this,\" said Kruger. \"Our children come from low-income households, most being raised by a single parent or foster parent working multiple jobs, and this time of year can be especially challenging for them. We're thrilled to give our kids this moment of holiday joy with their Big Brother or Big Sister alongside Jeremy Kerley and his 49ers teammates.\"  \r\n\r\nHere are some highlights from the event via social media\r\n\r\n> Last night was amazing [@JKerley11](https://twitter.com/JKerley11) [#ShopwithJK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShopwithJK?src=hash) Thanks every1 who were part [@BGSportsEntInc](https://twitter.com/BGSportsEntInc) [@bbbsbayarea](https://twitter.com/bbbsbayarea) [@Target](https://twitter.com/Target) [@rodstreater80](https://twitter.com/rodstreater80) [@TorreySmithWR](https://twitter.com/TorreySmithWR) [pic.twitter.com/jfJgwDM0oL](https://t.co/jfJgwDM0oL)\r\n>  — Brittany G.

[ The two are leaders on their respective side of the ball, but also share a unique bond off the field](/node/90346).  Don’t miss our photo galleries of Weddle ([click here](/media-vault/photo-gallery/Eric-Weddle-at-Training-Camp/9a86f122-c88a-4493-92fd-022c140f902f)) and Rivers ([click here](/media-vault/photo-gallery/Philip-Rivers-at-Training-Camp/fffd6aba-c6fa-4948-8bcd-055e82cff95d)) either.\r\n\r\nKendall Reyes made a strong impression down the stretch last season, most notably when he recorded 3.5 sacks in a Week 16 win over the Jets.

They did the surgery when he was six weeks old….  To have a surgery that young, to have (my son’s) ribcage cracked open, so the doctors can go in and operate kind of scares you.  I was in awe and I was shocked at first.  When I first found out that my first child was going to have a heart condition, it caught me off guard.  To be completely honest, it scared the heck out of me.”\r\n\r\nLiuget said the defect was discovered after his son was born and wasn’t hereditary.\r\n\r\nNow at four years old, Corey Jr. is happy and healthy.  Despite going in for periodic checkups, Liuget’s son can live life without any limitations.\r\n\r\n“It’s so rewarding to know I have a healthy, young son who is active.  I don’t have to be in the hospital with him; he’s not ill.  Some parents go through that every day and sit in the hospital with their kids.  (I’m lucky) because my son is at home and playing around in the yard.  I’m so thankful, blessed and fortunate that my child is okay and I don’t have to be a parent who’s concerned about seeing my child in the hospital every day.”\r\n",

Since Corey Jr.’s birth, he’s welcomed two daughters and has gained an appreciation for being present in the moment because you never know when life can change.\r\n\r\n“It’s given me a big appreciation for life because no one wants to see their child go through anything like that. To see him in so much pain and know that I couldn’t help him was the worst part.  You’d rather be in their position and let them sit where you’re at.  You’d rather take their place, feelings and everything they’re going through and let them be the one who is healthy, fine and living life.”\r\n\r\nDespite facing adversity, Liuget has become an advocate for ending heart disease.  This season, he’s teamed up with the San Diego Chapter of the American Heart Association for the 25",

            "Content": "SAN DIEGO – Home can be a comforting place.\r\n\r\nWith the California sun shining and the crowd backing the Chargers, San Diego avenged a season-opening loss at Kansas City.\r\n\r\nAntonio Gates caught two touchdown passes, the Chargers (1-1) forced six Jaguars turnovers and coasted to a 38-13 win Sunday at Qualcomm Stadium.\r\n\r\n“Defensively, we just kept bailing (ourselves) out in the first half,” Head Coach Norv Turner said. “The things I wanted to see from our team were a physical presence and the ability to pressure the quarterback, create turnovers and the ability to run the football\r\n\r\n“If we can keep getting better at those things, we can be the type of team I’ve been talking about.”\r\n\r\nLess than a week after slogging through torrential rain during an emotional loss that ended at the 6, the Week 2 outcome became like hardened cement soon after halftime.\r\n\r\nThe breaking point came earlier than that for Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nDarren Sproles secured a dump pass, shirked a tackler and skittered down the sideline for a 43-yard gain that jump-started a two-minute drive. Gates finished it with his second touchdown catch as San Diego snatched a two-score lead seconds before halftime.\r\n\r\n“We did find a way to score points obviously,” Turner said. “We got in a rhythm. We had a great two-minute drive at the end of the half.”\r\n\r\nJacksonville (1-1) never threatened in the second half after a turnover ended their initial drive deep in San Diego territory. Malcom Floyd’s 54-yard touchdown catch with 8:06 left punctuated a home opener and put the Chargers two points shy of the 40 they hung on Tennessee in 2006, the year they finished 14-2.\r\n\r\nThe Chargers have at least two losses in their first four games the last three years but made the playoffs each time. Sunday’s win ensures San Diego can dodge talk of a slow start for another week and has a chance to rid themselves of the reputation with a few more wins.\r\n\r\nGates, constantly doubled at Kansas City, found room to operate against Jacksonville. He nabbed a nine-yard touchdown catch across the middle that gave San Diego a 14-6 lead and had another pass bounce off his outstretched hands that led to a David Jones interception in the end zone.\r\n\r\n“You learn that you’ve got to put things behind you and move on,” Gates said. “Obviously I was able to get a chance to redeem myself.”\r\n\r\nThe second half became the Mike Tolbert show. The 5-foot-9, 243-pound running back pinballed off Jaguars defenders and even bounced outside for a 29-yard gain to open the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nWhen Tolbert barged into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown with 13:18 left, standing on top of the football and flexing, the outcome was all but sealed.\r\n\r\n“It’s a great feeling any time you control the tempo. We dictated the pace of the game. It’s a hell of a feeling,” Louis Vasquez said about playing with a comfortable advantage. “Pretty much we’re just big bullies out there pushing them around. They really don’t want to be out there and we know it, so we can move them out of the way and let the backs go run.”\r\n\r\nThe powerful special teams force and fullback Tolbert carried twice for 26 yards against Kansas City but saw the ball more Sunday as Ryan Mathews left the game with an ankle injury in the second quarter.\r\n\r\n“The guys rolled over on me and I tweaked it,” Mathews said. Everything is fine. I feel like I could’ve returned, but the coaches didn’t want to risk anything.”\r\n\r\nThe teams played an elaborate game of hot potato during the first half, combining for seven turnovers by the time Brandon Siler intercepted David Garrard with 8:31 left in the second quarter.\r\n\r\n“Honestly, it was kind of like a circus,” Gates said. “That’s something that we definitely will address.”\r\n\r\nAntoine Cason was involved with three. He intercepted a Garrard deep pass at the San Diego 6 on Jacksonville’s initial drive, secured a pass tipped by Shaun Phillips for his second and stripped Mike Sims-Walker, which led to a Kevin Burnett fumble recovery.\r\n\r\n“I think our defense won this football game for us,” Gates said. “They kept giving us opportunities to score. They kept giving us second chances and we were able to capitalize on some of those.”\r\n\r\nSaid Tolbert: “The crowd fed off our defense. I’ve been here two and a half years and I’ve never seen our defense play that good. I’m super happy for them because they did a tremendous job.”\r\n\r\n",

            "Content": " \r\n\r\n**SAN DIEGO –** Corey Liuget survived a gauntlet of good-natured ribbing and his first organized football practice in about eight months.\r\n\r\nOn the same day he signed a four-year contract with the Chargers, Liuget worked alongside Luis Castillo, Jacques Cesaire and the other defensive ends under close watch from Head Coach Norv Turner, the defensive coaching staff, the fans and the media.\r\n\r\n“It’s a privilege to wear one of these jerseys,” Liuget said, pointing to his Chargers’ No. 94. “Not a lot of people get to do it, so it definitely feels great.”\r\n\r\nLiuget won’t be expected to carry the load at defensive end, with Castillo, Cesaire and a thinner Vaughn Martin also in a position to contribute.\r\n\r\nDespite keeping in shape and studying his playbook throughout the summer, the sudden jolt into football at NFL speed left Liuget with a knowing grin.\r\n\r\nLiuget made 12.5 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks and 10 quarterback hurries as a junior in 2010, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. Now he’ll get to test himself against the best in football.\r\n\r\n“It’s definitely fast-paced. It’s not college,” Liuget said. “I definitely just want to show guys I belong here.”\r\n\r\nSaid Head Coach Norv Turner: “I’m sure things felt real fast for him. I’m sure his head’s spinning coming in and trying to get caught up. You know he’s athletic. He’s got great quickness. He’s a very physical player, so tomorrow we’ll get the pads on and we’ll give him another day.”\r\n\r\nA college defensive tackle, Liuget traded his old No. 93 for No. 94 with the Bolts in honor of his late father, who died in ’94. He took a moment after his first NFL practice to reflect.\r\n “I know (my dad) is proud,” Liuget said. “He’s looking at me right now.”",

            "Content": " \r\n\r\n**SAN DIEGO –** The Chargers faced a 10-point halftime deficit and the onset of déjà vu during Sunday’s regular-season opener at Qualcomm Stadium.\r\n\r\nSan Diego obliterated that notion with a dominant second half. A 40-yard Mike Scifres field goal and Mike Tolbert’s third touchdown gave the Bolts (1-0) a 24-17 comeback win against Minnesota (0-1).\r\n\r\n“I like the mindset of our football team because we obviously were in some games like that last year where things weren’t going the way we wanted,” Head Coach Norv Turner said. “Today we found a way to win. Every win in this league is precious because this is a competitive, competitive league.”\r\n\r\nThe Chargers shut out the Vikings after halftime, scoring 17 consecutive points to seize control late in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nWith the game tied 17-17, Philip Rivers avoided Jared Allen, scrambled left and shot-putted a pass to Mike Tolbert, who skimmed into the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown that sent a crowd of 66,716 into hysteria.\r\n\r\nThe Chargers held Adrian Peterson to 24 rushing yards in the second half and Antwan Barnes struck the final blow, bear-crawling to a sack on third-and-10 on the ensuing drive. Three first downs later, San Diego was able to run out the clock.\r\n\r\nTolbert also secured a 1-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter and scored again on a 7-yard run, turning himself into a human pinball and allowing his 243-pound frame to ricochet off defenders.\r\n\r\n“The guy played fullback the first two years. Last year he was the bruiser and now he’s the third down back,” Jacob Hester said of Tolbert. “He’s one of the most athletic guys I’ve ever seen. Basketball, soccer, he can play it. His development’s unbelievable.”\r\n\r\nMinnesota’s defense appeared determined to keep Rivers from finding Vincent Jackson or Malcom Floyd deep, dropping two safeties most of the game and blitzing on nearly every play.\r\n\r\nRivers found a groove by hitting Tolbert and Antonio Gates underneath for a combined 17 catches and 132 yards. The offensive line, helped at times by Hester and Randy McMichael, limited Minnesota to two sacks.\r\n\r\n“There for a little bit it turned into a blitz-a-thon. It seemed like they were bringing an extra guy every time,” Hester said. “That slowed down a little bit when we hit a couple plays, but they brought a lot of guys.”\r\n\r\nPercy Harvin ran the game’s opening kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown and the Chargers’ offense went three-and-out, an ominous start to the 2011 season.\r\n\r\nThen the defense, playing with five new starters, got a takeaway on their first play. Shaun Phillips tipped a screen pass to himself for an interception and Tolbert cruised uncovered into the corner of the West end zone three plays later.\r\n\r\nSan Diego’s defense seemed to be doing a decent job containing Adrian Peterson, but the Minnesota running back broke free for a 46-yard run to set up a 3-yard Michael Jenkins touchdown catch in the second quarter, affording the Vikings a 17-7 lead. Minnesota didn’t cross midfield the rest of the game.\r\n\r\n“In the preseason, everybody was talking about how (little) playing time we had together,”  Antonio Garay said of the defense. “We got all the horses out there, got the kinks worked out early and the second half speaks for itself.”\r\n\r\nThe Bolts’ two-minute offense moved the ball before halftime, but Antoine Winfield intercepted a pass after Rivers’ arm got whacked during his delivery. The Chargers responded by moving the first drive of the second half 69 yards for a touchdown. Nearly a quarter later, San Diego faced a fourth-and-13 from the Minnesota 22-yard line.\r\n\r\nEnter Scifres for his first NFL field goal attempt, a 40-yarder he placed between the uprights to tie the game. Less than five minutes later, Tolbert gave the Chargers their first lead.\r\n\r\n“Even though we’re not where we want to be, we’re winning,” Bob Sanders said. “That’s a positive thing.”\r\n\r\nSaid Rivers: “I would’ve loved not to have thrown any interceptions and we’d have loved not to have a kickoff run back and let it just be smooth and easy, but it’s these kinds of wins that you really grow (from) because you have to fight through some adversity and do it together.”\r\n\r\n**TWEET THE HEADLINE **\r\n\r\n*Congratulations to @**RyZilla124** for your [winning Tweet the Headline submission](http://twitter.com/#!/RyZilla124/status/113029147286192128) **used in this article.*\r\n\r\n*The San Diego Chargers and Motorola are giving Chargers fans around the world a chance to show support for their team when they \"Tweet the Headline\" for every Chargers home game during the 2010 season.

No phone calls.  I spoke to him once maybe last week.  We had a quick conversation.  But as this game gets closer, all communication ceases.  We cut it all off until the moments before the game when we say hello, take a photo and then after the game we’ll wish each other the best of luck and stay healthy.  Once the game is over it’s back to normal.  The communication goes full swing again.  But right now there is no communication.”",

            "Content": "\r\n\r\nThe two brothers won’t be the only Paganos in attendance Monday night.  Their parents will be at Qualcomm to watch their two sons square off.\r\n\r\n“My mom and dad are going to be there,” Pagano said, “Times we’ve played against each other before, I know my dad’s gone for walks.  He doesn’t even really watch the game.  He’s more inclined that he’s been here before and knows that at the end of the day someone is going to be happy and someone’s going to be sad.  My parents will be happy for whoever wins and they are there to pick up the other guy and cheer up whoever loses.  They’ve grown accustomed to this game.”\r\n\r\nStill, the Chargers defensive coordinator  is routinely quick to emphasize how at the end of the day, it’s about the players on the field and not about him and his brother.  Every game in the NFL is important, and Pagano agrees that this Monday is no exception.   His hope is that his defense feeds off of playing in front of a raucous Qualcomm Stadium.\r\n\r\n“The number one thing is going out and getting a victory against an AFC opponent and getting a win in front of our home crowd,” he explained. “I’m excited, especially against a high-powered offense, of any change we can get of crowd noise that we can use to our advantage.”\r\n\r\nPagano is also focused on getting his defense to get the better of the Colts offense.  One way of doing that is to play a strong 60 minutes of football.  The first couple games of the year they started out strong before faltering down the stretch, but the last two games showed a Bolts defense that played tough in the second half.  . \r\n\r\n“It’s almost been a roller coaster ride for us,” Pagano admitted.  “We’ve started fast in games and haven’t finished strong, and then recently we didn’t start fast but finished strong.  So it’s about going out and playing a complete game.  We need to put four quarters together and not lose the mindset or focus defensively to go out there and play a full 60 minute game.  That doesn’t change.  The game is never won in the first quarter, so we have to start fast and finish strong.  That’s the mentality.  We have to go out and put a good 60 minutes together.”      \r\n\r\nWhile it will be special to coach against his older brother, John Pagano is steadfast that the focus should remain on the players.  They are the ones who go out, execute the game plan, make the tackles and deserve all the praise.\r\n\r\n“We’ve faced each other so many times, it’s more about the team and the guys out on the field playing than it is about us,” he said. “To me, it’s an honor to be able to coach a game against him as a head coach.  It’s pretty cool looking across to the other sideline and having a family member standing there, looking at you and giving the tip of the cap before the game.  It’s pretty cool.  That to me is most important. But at the end of the day it’s about the guys that go out there and play.  We’re not the ones out there tackling, running around, blocking and catching.” \r\n\r\nTickets still remain for Monday night’s game.  [Click here to purchase](/tickets/single-game-tickets.html).",

We continue our series with…*\r\n\r\n<nobr>[<span>Brandon Thomas</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/brandon-thomas/65f7d6d4-20fa-4515-9d18-200b9ebc1744/ \"Brandon Thomas\")</nobr> will not play for the San Francisco 49ers in 2014.\r\n\r\nBut Thomas could play for the 49ers for many years beyond this one.\r\n\r\nThomas, the team’s third-round NFL Draft pick last May, tore the ACL in his right knee during an April workout for the New Orleans Saints.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his injury, the offensive lineman predictably slid down draft boards.\r\n\r\nBut Thomas’ college coach said he thinks his former left tackle will be “an absolute steal” for San Francisco.\r\n\r\n“I’m excited because I felt like he was going to be a definite, easy second-rounder and unfortunate that he got hurt,” Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney told 49ers.com over the phone from South Carolina. “For the 49ers, I think it speaks volumes of them to be confident enough in their evaluations to still take him early in the third round with his injury. Coach (Jim) Harbaugh and his staff are going to really love Brandon Thomas once he gets back out onto the field.”\r\n\r\nSwinney also had this to say about the bright if beleaguered prospect…\r\n\r\n**<b style=\"color: #545865; font-family: 'Arial Regular', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14.77199935913086px;\"><b style=\"line-height: 14.77199935913086px;\"><b style=\"line-height: 14.77199935913086px;\">****<b span=\"\" style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 14px; color: #aa0000;\">******<b span=\"\">First Impressions  \r\n**********************<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">“Brandon is a very reserved, simple, quiet guy,” Swinney said. “When you see him, you look at him with his glasses on – he looks like he just walked out of a library. Always clean-cut, very well dressed, very well spoken. Loves his mom and his sister. He’s not a rah-rah guy. He just goes about his business. To be honest, you would never even notice him. He’s a fly on the wall, but you notice him when he gets on the field.</span><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> </span>\r\n\r\n“We knew when he was in high school that he was special. He actually played a lot of tight end then. We were just blown away by his speed and athleticism and his ability to run.”\r\n\r\n**<b style=\"color: #545865; font-family: 'Arial Regular', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14.77199935913086px;\"><b style=\"line-height: 14.77199935913086px;\"><b style=\"line-height: 14.77199935913086px;\">****<b span=\"\" style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 14px; color: #aa0000;\">******<b span=\"\">College Improvements**********************  \r\n ",

Okoye stayed true to his English routes, cheering for Man United.\r\n\r\nAnd if you follow the 49ers on social media, you most likely saw their reaction to the matchup at Levi’s® Stadium live.\r\n\r\nReid took over the 49ers [Twitter](https://twitter.com/49ers), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SANFRANCISCO49ERS) and “officialSF49ers” Snapchat accounts while Okoye ran the show for [NFL UK](https://twitter.com/nfl_uk).\r\n\r\nManchester United earned a 3-1 victory thanks to goals by Wayne Rooney, Jesse Lingard and Adnan Januzaj, but there were plenty of highlights on Saturday, as well as the rest of the week.\r\n\r\nThe 49ers met several players from Manchester United and FC Barcelona just days before their match. Offensive lineman <nobr>[<span>Joe Staley</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/joe-staley/fa308b6d-c61d-4bbb-8e67-8ddb8dc89901/ \"Joe Staley\")</nobr> also participated in the meet and greet with the winners of the UEFA Champions League, assisting his soccer counterparts with a helmet fitting.

But in the days leading up to Monday night’s match against the Colts, it’s radio silent between the two.\r\n\r\n“There’s no communication between us right now,” he said. “No text messages.  No phone calls.  I spoke to him once maybe last week.  We had a quick conversation.  But as this game gets closer, all communication ceases.  We cut it all off until the moments before the game when we say hello, take a photo and then after the game we’ll wish each other the best of luck and stay healthy.  Once the game is over it’s back to normal.  The communication goes full swing again.  But right now there is no communication.”[wysifield-embedded_video|eid=\"233776\"|type=\"embedded_video\"|view_mode=\"full\"]\r\n\r\nThe two brothers won’t be the only Paganos in attendance Monday night.  Their parents will be at Qualcomm to watch their two sons square off.\r\n\r\n“My mom and dad are going to be there,” Pagano said, “Times we’ve played against each other before, I know my dad’s gone for walks.  He doesn’t even really watch the game.  He’s more inclined that he’s been here before and knows that at the end of the day someone is going to be happy and someone’s going to be sad.  My parents will be happy for whoever wins and they are there to pick up the other guy and cheer up whoever loses.  They’ve grown accustomed to this game.”\r\n\r\nStill, the Chargers defensive coordinator  is routinely quick to emphasize how at the end of the day, it’s about the players on the field and not about him and his brother.  Every game in the NFL is important, and Pagano agrees that this Monday is no exception.   His hope is that his defense feeds off of playing in front of a raucous Qualcomm Stadium.\r\n\r\n“The number one thing is going out and getting a victory against an AFC opponent and getting a win in front of our home crowd,” he explained. “I’m excited, especially against a high-powered offense, of any change we can get of crowd noise that we can use to our advantage.”\r\n\r\nPagano is also focused on getting his defense to get the better of the Colts offense.  One way of doing that is to play a strong 60 minutes of football.  The first couple games of the year they started out strong before faltering down the stretch, but the last two games showed a Bolts defense that played tough in the second half.  . \r\n\r\n“It’s almost been a roller coaster ride for us,” Pagano admitted.  “We’ve started fast in games and haven’t finished strong, and then recently we didn’t start fast but finished strong.  So it’s about going out and playing a complete game.  We need to put four quarters together and not lose the mindset or focus defensively to go out there and play a full 60 minute game.  That doesn’t change.  The game is never won in the first quarter, so we have to start fast and finish strong.  That’s the mentality.  We have to go out and put a good 60 minutes together.”      \r\n\r\nWhile it will be special to coach against his older brother, John Pagano is steadfast that the focus should remain on the players.  They are the ones who go out, execute the game plan, make the tackles and deserve all the praise.\r\n\r\n“We’ve faced each other so many times, it’s more about the team and the guys out on the field playing than it is about us,” he said. “To me, it’s an honor to be able to coach a game against him as a head coach.  It’s pretty cool looking across to the other sideline and having a family member standing there, looking at you and giving the tip of the cap before the game.  It’s pretty cool.  That to me is most important. But at the end of the day it’s about the guys that go out there and play.  We’re not the ones out there tackling, running around, blocking and catching.” \r\n\r\nTickets still remain for Monday night’s game.  [Click here to purchase](/tickets/single-game-tickets.html).",

            "Content": "  \r\n\r\nWith six weeks until the 2017 NFL Draft, our panel of NFL Draft experts is back to share their take on another pressing topic. Who is the top wide receiver prospect in the 2017 NFL Draft? The two leading candidates are Clemson's Mike Williams and Western Michigan's Corey Davis.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco 49ers added three wide receivers in free agency last week: <nobr>[<span>Pierre Garçon</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/pierre-garon/d613e1a6-f54b-4888-918b-85cccd5e2eee/ \"Pierre Garçon\")</nobr>, <nobr>[<span>Marquise Goodwin</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/marquise-goodwin/ae413cd1-ccca-44e0-a45a-5cf7869d6cf8/ \"Marquise Goodwin\")</nobr> and <nobr>[<span>Aldrick Robinson</span>![](http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif)](/team/roster/aldrick-robinson/08dd480e-3502-4be9-a4cc-473666b3c75e/ \"Aldrick Robinson\")</nobr>. That said, it shouldn't be assumed that the 49ers won't target a receiving threat on Draft Day.\r\n\r\nWilliams won a national championship in 2016 with the Tigers. He caught eight passes for 94 yards and one touchdown in the title game against Alabama. For the season, Williams posted 98 receptions for 1,361 yards and 11 touchdowns, all of which were career-highs. Davis set career-highs in 2016 as well, racking up 97 receptions for 1,500 receiving yards and 19 touchdowns as a senior with the Broncos. Both Williams and Davis have plenty of size, each standing 6-foot-3.\r\n\r\nHere's what our experts had to say regarding their choice between the two.**  \r\n\r\nDaniel Jeremiah, NFL Network: Corey Davis **\r\n\r\n“I love both of them, but I have Corey Davis as my top guy. I think they’re both No. 1 guys. When people ask, ‘What’s the definition of a No. 1 receiver?’ I say that it’s on third down or in the red zone, when everyone in the whole stadium knows where it’s going, and the defense can’t do anything about it. I think both of those guys fit that description. I think they’re ready to come in and make an immediate impact on Day 1.\"**  \r\n\r\nMatt Bowen, ESPN: Mike Williams**\r\n\r\n“I think it’s Mike Williams right now. A good comparison for him is Alshon Jeffrey, with a little more explosive-play ability and athleticism. Corey Davis reminds me of a Brandon Marshall. He’s physical, he’s strong, he can run inside-breaking routes all day. He can produce after the catch. You can make an argument that he’s No. 1, too. You can’t go wrong. They’re both size/speed guys with natural ability. I think with Williams, you get a little more at the point of attack, talking 50/50 throws down the field.”**  \r\n\r\nWill Brinson, CBS Sports: Corey Davis**\r\n\r\n“Mike Williams has the pedigree. Clemson produces consistent NFL-caliber wide receivers. That being said, Corey Davis has probably been a more complete receiver in terms of how his game has developed. It doesn’t bother me at all to have a guy who played lower level competition. I don’t think that will hinder Davis. He’s my guy.”**  \r\n\r\nDane Brugler, CBS Sports: Mike Williams**\r\n\r\n“I lean towards Mike Williams. He’s bigger. He’s probably not the same caliber of athlete, but I feel more comfortable with him down the field in contested situations. He can climb the ladder. I like Corey Davis quite a bit, too. He can do a little bit of everything. He reminds me a lot of (New Orleans Saints wide receiver) Michael Thomas. Back to Williams, he’s got something special. You just throw it in his zip code and he finds a way to come down with it. He feels like a combination of A.J. Green and Michael Floyd.”",

But that’s what happened to Niners wide receiver Torrey Smith on Thursday.\r\n\r\nWhile deep-sea fishing with a few friends for tuna, Smith managed to hook a ferocious predator instead.\r\n\r\n“That thing is huge!” Smith can be heard saying in a video posted to his [Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/TorreySmithWR/). “Do you see this?”\r\n\r\nSmith and his fellow fishermen eventually cut the shark loose, but not before documenting their unusual catch on film.\r\n\r\n“That was fun,” Smith said. “Let’s see what else we can catch.”  \r\n\r\n <div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TorreySmithWR/videos/1126897364007326/\" data-width=\"588\"> <div class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"> ",
